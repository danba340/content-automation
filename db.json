          "selftext": "Late to the party but this one is too good to pass up:\n\nI was once on a US military ship, having breakfast in the wardroom (officers lounge) when the Operations Officer (OPS) walks in.  This guy was the definition of NOT a morning person; he's still half asleep, bleary eyed... basically a zombie with a bagel.  He sits down across from me to eat his bagel and is just barely conscious.  My back is to the outboard side of the ship, and the morning sun is blazing in one of the portholes putting a big bright-ass circle of light right on his barely conscious face.  He's squinting and chewing and basically just remembering how to be alive for today.  It's painful to watch.\n\nBut then zombie-OPS stops chewing, slowly picks up the phone, and dials the bridge.  In his well-known I'm-still-totally-asleep voice, he says \"heeeey.  It's OPS.  Could you... shift our barpat... yeah, one six five.  Thanks.\" And puts the phone down.  And then he just sits there.  Squinting.  Waiting.\n  \nAnd then, ever so slowly, I realize that that big blazing spot of sun has begun to slide off the zombie's face and onto the wall behind him.  After a moment it clears his face and he blinks slowly a few times and the brilliant beauty of what I've just witnessed begins to overwhelm me.  By ordering the bridge to adjust the ship's back-and-forth patrol by about 15 degrees, he's changed our course just enough to reposition the sun off of his face.  He's literally just redirected thousands of tons of steel and hundreds of people so that he could get the sun out of his eyes while he eats his bagel.  I am in awe.  \n\nHe slowly picks up his bagel and for a moment I'm terrified at the thought that his own genius may escape him, that he may never appreciate the epic brilliance of his laziness (since he's not going to wake up for another hour).  But between his next bites he pauses, looks at me, and gives me the faintest, sly grin, before returning to gnaw slowly on his zombie bagel.",

I threw it out and thought little of it.\n\nOn the 19th, I found another post it note on the back of my desk chair, in the same handwriting as the previous note, telling me to make sure I \"saved my documents\". I was  freaked out, but there were no other signs of a break-in, so I set up a web-cam in my house aimed at my desk and used a security-cam app for it to record after detecting movement.\n\nOn the 28th, I woke up to find another post-it note, this one saying, \"Our landlord isn't letting me talk to you, but it's important we do.\" I immediately checked the webcam's folder on my computer and found nothing from the night before, but my computer's recycling bin had been emptied, which I am certain I did not do recently, indicating someone had noticed the webcam and deleted the files. (They were just saved straight to a folder on my desktop called \"Webcam\". \n\nToday, on the 1st of May, I found another post it note, this time on the outside of my door, with nothing written on it– and there also appeared to be post-its on many other doors in my apartment complex, all blank, in varying colors.\n\nDo I have any legal recourse here? I have no proof except for the post-its, but those are written by my pen and on my post-it notes, so conceivably I could have faked them. Would contacting the police get me into any trouble, if they can't determine an outside source for this? I just want to make sure I'm not wasting anyone's time. \n\nShould I consult my landlord?

          "selftext": "I was day tripping to Vancouver from Seattle and stopped in for lunch at a little cafe.  From my window I saw a young teenage girl out in the cold, squatted down in a closed up businesses doorway, holding a small bundle in her arms.  She was panhandling, people were mostly walking by ignoring her.  She looked just broken.\r\n\r\nI finished up my meal and went outside, went through my wallet and thought I'd give her $5 for some food.   I got up to her and she was sobbing, she looked like she was 14-15.  And that bundle in her arms was a baby wrapped up.  I felt like I just got punched in the chest.  She looked up putting on a game face and asked for any change, I asked her if she's like some lunch. Right next door was a small quick-Trip type grocery store, I got a can of formula for the baby (very young, maybe 2-3 months old.), and took her back to the cafe though I'd just eaten.  She was very thankful, got a burger and just inhaled it. Got her some pie and ice cream.  She opened up and we talked.  She was 15, got pregnant, parents were angry and she was fighting with them.   She ran away.  She's been gone almost 1 full year.\r\n\r\nI asked her if she's like to go home and she got silent.  I coaxed her, she said her parents wouldn't want her back.  I coaxed further, she admitted she stole 5k in cash from her Dad.  Turns out 5k doesn't last long at all and the streets are tough on a 15 year old.  Very tough.  She did want to go back, but she was afraid no one wanted her back after what she did.\r\n\r\nWe talked more, I wanted her to use my phone to call home but she wouldn't.  I told her I'd call and see if her folks wanted to talk to her, she hesitated and gave bad excuses but eventually agreed.  She dialed the number and I took the phone, her Mom picked up and I said hello.  Awkwardly introduced myself and said her daughter would like to speak to her, silence, and I heard crying.  Gave the phone to the girl and she was just quiet listening to her Mom cry, and then said hello.  And she cried.  They talked, she gave the phone back to me, I talked to her Mom some more.\r\n\r\nI drove her down to the bus station and bought her a bus ticket home.  Gave her $100 cash for incidentals, and some formula, diapers, wipes, snacks for the road.\r\n\r\nGot to the bus, and she just cried saying thank you over and over.  I gave her a kiss on the forehead and a hug, kissed her baby, and she got on the bus.\r\n\r\nI get a chistmas card every year from her.  She's 21 now and in college.\r\n\r\nHer name is Makayla and her baby was Joe.  \r\n\r\nI've never really told anyone about this.  I just feel good knowing I did something good in this world.  Maybe it'll make up for the things I've f-ed up.",

I also remember looking at my brother on his iPad with max brightness and thinking to myself \"he should turn down the brightness or he'll bother uncle\". It wasn't until the next morning when I got woken up with a knock at the door, and it was the detectives and my uncle's parole officer. They spoke with my grandma and told her my uncle was in the hospital, I didn't think too much of it because he had went to the hospital a week prior for stomach issues.\n\nAn hour later I got a call from my sister crying saying my uncle had been hit by a car and was brain dead. For the rest of the day I thought that this had to have happened sometime after 3 in the morning. Later that night we found out that it had happened around 9:30, while I was at work and before I even got home.\n\nI don't really know what to think of it.

I put on a dog YouTube channel and got in the shower. He followed me in the bathroom and waited by the door, then all of the sudden he trotted off very intentionally. I was worried he was going to do something naughty like pee somewhere or look for a shoe to chew on, but he ignored my calls which was odd for him. Normally he comes running. When I got out of the shower, I called his name, but he was nowhere to be found. I looked in the closet, under the bed, everywhere he possibly could be. I heard a faint whimper, like he was trapped somewhere. It was muffled like he was trapped under blankets or behind a wall, but my bed was made and there was nowhere he could have been. I wondered if maybe he fell between the mattress or something, but I checked and he wasn’t there either. I thought I was going crazy. \n\nI checked under the bed one more time and then when I looked up, he dropped onto the bed like he was exiting stairs or being dropped from somewhere, and was wagging his tail like, “what is it?” Like nothing had happened. It was very strange and I cannot imagine where he would have gone. He just reappeared very randomly out of thin air.",

I put on a dog YouTube channel and got in the shower. He followed me in the bathroom and waited by the door, then all of the sudden he trotted off very intentionally. I was worried he was going to do something naughty like pee somewhere or look for a shoe to chew on, but he ignored my calls which was odd for him. Normally he comes running. When I got out of the shower, I called his name, but he was nowhere to be found. I looked in the closet, under the bed, everywhere he possibly could be. I heard a faint whimper, like he was trapped somewhere. It was muffled like he was trapped under blankets or behind a wall, but my bed was made and there was nowhere he could have been. I wondered if maybe he fell between the mattress or something, but I checked and he wasn’t there either. I thought I was going crazy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I checked under the bed one more time and then when I looked up, he dropped onto the bed like he was exiting stairs or being dropped from somewhere, and was wagging his tail like, “what is it?” Like nothing had happened. It was very strange and I cannot imagine where he would have gone. He just reappeared very randomly out of thin air.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "My sister moved multiple states away 3 years ago.\n\nHer husband gives her very thoughtful jewelry pieces every mother's day. They're always extremely sentimental and bespoke to convey a specific sentiment or memory. \n\n2 years ago, he gave her a gold necklace with a heart, carved inside with their family's initials and year of birth, with diamonds to the center where the heart meets a point (because it's their daughter's birthstone). Since being given that gift, she's never left the state to visit home. She's also never been to my current house even before leaving (I also live pretty far from home and family hasn't made the visit, but I've lived here 7 years now and haven't moved or spent long visits with my family, just daytime drop ins). \n\nMy sister's necklace went missing some time in spring last year. She thought it might have broken and fallen off while out and about and she was very distressed about it because it was an expensive gift and felt horrible about it going missing. When we chatted about it she actually told me she wasn't going to tell her husband about it until she's searched EVERYWHERE possible. The entire house, the car, her work place. She even called the stores she's shopped at regularly asking if it was found and turned in, but nothing. \n\nJust this week I was pulling out old clothes and shoes to donate. My son went through a growth spurt and I got wider and I figured it was time to clean house. I was pulling out all the shoes and purses at the bottom of my closet and there, in the very back of my closet, I found my sister's necklace. \n\nThere's absolutely NO way that this could have ended up here. My sister hasn't come home to visit and there's no way this would have ended up in our state in MY HOUSE without her having mailed it personally, and she's never mailed me anything (besides sending gifts directly from the seller that she'd never have personally touched). And it's not as though it's a similar looking piece, or a mass produced item. This was specifically carved with their birth years and initials, and their daughters diamond birth stone. \n\nBut it gets even more strange. I immediately face time her when I find it. I was already trying to figure out how on earth it would have come to be in my closet... I haven't gone to her state yet, my son hasn't visited there, our parents had but they went before she had gotten the gift. When she picked up and I showed her what I had found I was honestly bracing myself because I was sure she was going to be just as confused and have a million questions I couldn't answer. But when I showed her what I found, she set the phone down to put herself in full view, and pulled out her necklace from under her blouse. She had her necklace!! Not just that, but she had no recollection of losing it. No memory at all of talking to me about losing it, searching her house, or calling shops. In fact she was sure she's always had it in her jewelry box and thought I was being weird about finding the same one because it was likely a really common necklace. When I pointed out that it had their same initials and birth years carved into it, she just shrugged and said it was a coincidence but not all that strange. When I pressed it she laughed and assumed I was pulling a prank of some kind (which is EXTREMELY out of my character, I am not one to pull pranks) and asked if I had it made as some kind of joke. \n\nI am at a total loss here. I feel like reality is all jumbled up and I'm the only one who noticed it's off. I was so confused so I called our mom and told her what happened. I told her the whole thing asking if she recalled her losing the necklace, I was sure if she did it would have come up in their calls as well. She didn't recall anything. But the way she acted in the call was even more strange, she says 'well these things happen don't let it drive you crazy, our family is just sensitive to these things' and then wouldn't elaborate on it. Which is also very unlike her character.\n\nhttps://postimg.cc/JD2cyMbn",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My sister moved multiple states away 3 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her husband gives her very thoughtful jewelry pieces every mother&amp;#39;s day. They&amp;#39;re always extremely sentimental and bespoke to convey a specific sentiment or memory. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 years ago, he gave her a gold necklace with a heart, carved inside with their family&amp;#39;s initials and year of birth, with diamonds to the center where the heart meets a point (because it&amp;#39;s their daughter&amp;#39;s birthstone). Since being given that gift, she&amp;#39;s never left the state to visit home. She&amp;#39;s also never been to my current house even before leaving (I also live pretty far from home and family hasn&amp;#39;t made the visit, but I&amp;#39;ve lived here 7 years now and haven&amp;#39;t moved or spent long visits with my family, just daytime drop ins). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My sister&amp;#39;s necklace went missing some time in spring last year. She thought it might have broken and fallen off while out and about and she was very distressed about it because it was an expensive gift and felt horrible about it going missing. When we chatted about it she actually told me she wasn&amp;#39;t going to tell her husband about it until she&amp;#39;s searched EVERYWHERE possible. The entire house, the car, her work place. She even called the stores she&amp;#39;s shopped at regularly asking if it was found and turned in, but nothing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just this week I was pulling out old clothes and shoes to donate. My son went through a growth spurt and I got wider and I figured it was time to clean house. I was pulling out all the shoes and purses at the bottom of my closet and there, in the very back of my closet, I found my sister&amp;#39;s necklace. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s absolutely NO way that this could have ended up here. My sister hasn&amp;#39;t come home to visit and there&amp;#39;s no way this would have ended up in our state in MY HOUSE without her having mailed it personally, and she&amp;#39;s never mailed me anything (besides sending gifts directly from the seller that she&amp;#39;d never have personally touched). And it&amp;#39;s not as though it&amp;#39;s a similar looking piece, or a mass produced item. This was specifically carved with their birth years and initials, and their daughters diamond birth stone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it gets even more strange. I immediately face time her when I find it. I was already trying to figure out how on earth it would have come to be in my closet... I haven&amp;#39;t gone to her state yet, my son hasn&amp;#39;t visited there, our parents had but they went before she had gotten the gift. When she picked up and I showed her what I had found I was honestly bracing myself because I was sure she was going to be just as confused and have a million questions I couldn&amp;#39;t answer. But when I showed her what I found, she set the phone down to put herself in full view, and pulled out her necklace from under her blouse. She had her necklace!! Not just that, but she had no recollection of losing it. No memory at all of talking to me about losing it, searching her house, or calling shops. In fact she was sure she&amp;#39;s always had it in her jewelry box and thought I was being weird about finding the same one because it was likely a really common necklace. When I pointed out that it had their same initials and birth years carved into it, she just shrugged and said it was a coincidence but not all that strange. When I pressed it she laughed and assumed I was pulling a prank of some kind (which is EXTREMELY out of my character, I am not one to pull pranks) and asked if I had it made as some kind of joke. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am at a total loss here. I feel like reality is all jumbled up and I&amp;#39;m the only one who noticed it&amp;#39;s off. I was so confused so I called our mom and told her what happened. I told her the whole thing asking if she recalled her losing the necklace, I was sure if she did it would have come up in their calls as well. She didn&amp;#39;t recall anything. But the way she acted in the call was even more strange, she says &amp;#39;well these things happen don&amp;#39;t let it drive you crazy, our family is just sensitive to these things&amp;#39; and then wouldn&amp;#39;t elaborate on it. Which is also very unlike her character.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://postimg.cc/JD2cyMbn\"&gt;https://postimg.cc/JD2cyMbn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

My boyfriend gets up to grab a snack from the kitchen while we let the episode keep playing. \nOur kitchen and living room are separated by a thin wall, as the kitchen leads to the living room. So he could still hear the episode well in case any action picked up. Well, one character says something along the lines of \"why do you care about this woman anyway? She is a criminal\". Mind you, we were watching subbed, so all this is in Japanese. I'm reading subtitles, but my boyfriend can't at the moment. But after the character asked that question, my boyfriend from the kitchen yells \"because she's my friend, dumbass!\"\nI pause the episode immediately and walk into the kitchen and ask how my boyfriend knew what they were saying. He got this look of realization followed by confusion and horror on his face. His exact response was \"I don't know, I just....I don't know\".\nHe's never spoken another language other than English. Never taken any Japanese classes, never even downloaded Duolingo. \nWe are both just so creeped out by it.\n\nETA: I don't believe he watched the episode without me, as we don't care if each other is a couple of episodes ahead sometimes. He will usually tell me when he does like \"hey I watched these episodes while you were asleep, so I know what happens\". But he claims he didn't watch ahead this time.",

My boyfriend gets up to grab a snack from the kitchen while we let the episode keep playing. \nOur kitchen and living room are separated by a thin wall, as the kitchen leads to the living room. So he could still hear the episode well in case any action picked up. Well, one character says something along the lines of &amp;quot;why do you care about this woman anyway? She is a criminal&amp;quot;. Mind you, we were watching subbed, so all this is in Japanese. I&amp;#39;m reading subtitles, but my boyfriend can&amp;#39;t at the moment. But after the character asked that question, my boyfriend from the kitchen yells &amp;quot;because she&amp;#39;s my friend, dumbass!&amp;quot;\nI pause the episode immediately and walk into the kitchen and ask how my boyfriend knew what they were saying. He got this look of realization followed by confusion and horror on his face. His exact response was &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know, I just....I don&amp;#39;t know&amp;quot;.\nHe&amp;#39;s never spoken another language other than English. Never taken any Japanese classes, never even downloaded Duolingo. \nWe are both just so creeped out by it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ETA: I don&amp;#39;t believe he watched the episode without me, as we don&amp;#39;t care if each other is a couple of episodes ahead sometimes. He will usually tell me when he does like &amp;quot;hey I watched these episodes while you were asleep, so I know what happens&amp;quot;. But he claims he didn&amp;#39;t watch ahead this time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Only those closest to me know that this happened until now.\n\n  \nWhen I was 25 years old I was driving home from work one night. I lived in Los Angeles at the time. I was driving on Sunset Boulevard heading west towards my apartment in Brentwood.  For those that are not familiar with the area there is an expanse of Sunset, near UCLA, that is very curvy. It is 2 lanes on either side with no shoulder.\n\n  \nIt was 8:30 on a Saturday night so there was some traffic. I was driving along and all of a sudden about 50 feet in front of me I saw a car but I was looking at the passenger door. A car had spun out of control and was perpendicular in my lane. I didn't have time to stop. I looked to my right and saw there was a car next to me so I had nowhere to go. I instinctively turned my car all the way to the right anyway. Once I had cleared the first car I spun it all the way to the left still trying to avoid the 2nd car.\n\n  \nWhile all of  this was happening I remembered a time with my mom at Disneyworld when I was 3. This is not a memory I have ever had. I vaguely remember parts of that trip but this memory was not one of them. I realized then that my life was flashing before me and I was going to die. I had never been so sure of anything. Every part of me knew I was about to die. I started screaming, to this day I don't know if I vocalized anything or it was all in my head. I yelled \"No, no this isn't fair. I'm not done yet\", all the while swerving all over Sunset Blvd. I suddenly stopped my car and I was now perpendicular in the opposing lane of traffic.\n\n  \nI looked around and there was not a single car anywhere. It was like everything had been wiped clean. I put my car in reverse and proceeded home. I did not see a single car the rest of the way. I was only 5 minutes away from home at that point but Sunset Blvd on a Saturday night was completely empty. I got to my apartment and parked on the street. I didn't see one person. While walking to my apartment I came to the conclusion that I had died and because I said \"No\" I was stuck in some limbo.\n\n  \nI had never wanted my roommate to be home so badly, unfortunately she wasn't. I called one of my best friends and said, \"I need to ask you some questions. Please just answer me and I will explain after\". I asked her my name, my age, what city we lived in and the date. Obviously she was very alarmed. I explained that I thought I was dead and I wasn't sure I was really on the phone with her. She tried to convince me that I was alive and that everything was okay.\n\n  \nThere was no way mathematically to escape it. There was nowhere for the car on the right to go.  \nThis moment has haunted me my whole life. There have been times when I have questioned my existence. I've wondered if my \"life\" since has been a very detailed death trip and I'm actually lying on Sunset Blvd bleeding out.\n\nAfter many years of meditation, spiritual practice and belief in quantum physics, I wonder what life I jumped into.  \n",

          "selftext": "Hi there, I’m a 39 year old female, and this occurred I think a little over a year ago.  This was a very real event.  No drugs, no alcohol.  I was in our bathroom which has a line of sight out the back window to where my hubby passes by before coming in the door.  So, I was just doing my hair, and looked over to see him outside the window walking up, switching the Kroger bag to his other hand to grab his keys, etc., then heard the door, and watched him walk by to the kitchen.  I said “Hey baby” and he didn’t hear me (not surprising, his hearing isn’t the best) but I heard him lay the bags down, then lay his keys and wallet down, so I stuck a clip in that last bit of hair to do, and started out the bathroom door to go give him a hug/kiss.      Well here it is.  Instantly, when I walked outside the doorway of the bathroom, everything was completely different.  All the lights were out, and they had certainly been on a moment prior. Totally weirded out, I felt shaky and what not, but I guess managed to walk a few steps to look toward the kitchen, only to see my husband wasn’t even there.  Then, before I even had time to attempt to process what the hell just happened, I saw through our kitchen window, his headlights coming down the driveway.  It was then I started getting extra weirded out and for sure had to sit down.  I remember I propped myself sitting on the edge of the couch arm, and the next part is what freaks me out the absolute most.  I couldn’t believe my eyes at all- as I watched him walk across that window, it was like someone had just literally rewound a tape and was replaying it.  The exact same motions, the same exact sounds.  All the way through including him setting the keys and bags down.  The only thing I could think at that point is how crazy I would actually sound if I told anyone this  (Except told my husband right when he got there.) So, I just want to know if anyone has any ideas of what happened… I’m open to hear about it.  It’s the single most unbelievable, existential type thing that’s happened in my life,  I will never ever forget it.  Thank you anyone who bothered to read/respond!",

It is also the place of his current preschool, but at that time, he attended a different preschool and had NEVER stepped foot in or talked about the big white church. \n\nSo we drove by one day and he said “oh there’s the church that I ate cereal in”. My husband and I looked at each other and I said, “what do you mean? We’ve never been there before”. We asked some additional questions but he didn’t really answer. However, he was very adamant about being there and eating cereal. \n\nThis happened during a very difficult time\nin our lives. My father in law was on hospice and dying of cancer. For weeks, we were up and back to my in laws house- this church being along the route. He said it a few more times and then never mentioned it again. \n\nFast forward to today- he currently attends preschool at said church.  He has been going since September and we love it. It is Christian though we aren’t very religious. Anyway, I got the monthly newsletter and it mentioned that next month is pajama day where the kids wear pajamas and….eat cereal. \n\nI told my son and asked him if he remembered eating cereal there before. He said no and had no recollection of saying that he did.\n\nIs there an explanation to this? It gives me chills when I think about it.",

This church is one that we pass often driving around town. It is also the place of his current preschool, but at that time, he attended a different preschool and had NEVER stepped foot in or talked about the big white church. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we drove by one day and he said “oh there’s the church that I ate cereal in”. My husband and I looked at each other and I said, “what do you mean? We’ve never been there before”. We asked some additional questions but he didn’t really answer. However, he was very adamant about being there and eating cereal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This happened during a very difficult time\nin our lives. My father in law was on hospice and dying of cancer. For weeks, we were up and back to my in laws house- this church being along the route. He said it a few more times and then never mentioned it again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today- he currently attends preschool at said church.  He has been going since September and we love it. It is Christian though we aren’t very religious. Anyway, I got the monthly newsletter and it mentioned that next month is pajama day where the kids wear pajamas and….eat cereal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told my son and asked him if he remembered eating cereal there before. He said no and had no recollection of saying that he did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there an explanation to this? It gives me chills when I think about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I returned to my home country after 1 year from a university abroad. My father picked me up from the airport ,and we had dinner at home. Everything was as usual as it could be. I went bed around 12 PM and slept immediately. I woke up around 5 AM to pee ,and went directly to the bathroom which is in my room, so I didn't stepped out of my room.\r\n\nWe all think different things when peeing such as the colour of the walls or what to eat for breakfast. For this time; out of nowhere I started thinking that if I were to choose one would i choose my mother or my father is being dead. Then, I thought my sister would be devastated without my mother, and my father cannot handle my sister in her teenage years. I decided that absence of my father would be easier than losing my mother.\r\n\nI finished peeing and just about to get back to my bed, I heard a strong snoring noise. My father was always snoring since my childhood, and sometimes we were having fun with it. However, this time it felt stronger and not natural. The noise led me to the living room where I found my father lying on the couch, with a little blood on his nose. I tried to woke him up ,but he was unconscious. I called 911, woke my mother up, but once we arrived to the hospital, he was passed away. He was 48. Doctors said it is because celebral hemorrhage by high blood pressure. We dont know what time it happened.\r\n\nI am still confused with the situation. I wasnt there for 1 year, and had the chance of having one last dinner and conversation with my father. I found him like that and acted with cold blood. I cant imagine the trauma they would live through if my mother or sister would find him lying on the couch.\r\n\nAnd of course, I still think why did I think such thing in the bathroom, and what would happen if I would choose my mother.\r\n\nThank you for reading and sharing my memory",

The dog had a barking problem too, but I'm not hating on the dog.\r  \n\r  \nOne evening I had problems with the internet and for shits and giggles I tried to connect to my neighbour's wifi with a password - \"0123456789\". Guess what...it connected :D.\r  \n\r  \nThe same evening at 11PM I started hearing shitty drum n bass from my neighbor's apartment as usual and all of a sudden I see a pop up appear on my phone.\r  \n\r  \nI have a Samsung phone and when you open the YouTube app on any Samsung Smart TV, a pop up appears on your phone with the TV casted YouTube app (as long as both devices are on the same wifi network). You have full control of \"TV YouTube\" on your phone. Pause, play, volume, skip video if it's a playlist, choose a different recommended video, etc.\r  \n\r  \nAt first I did not realize what the pop up was and just thought \"Wtf is this\". I thought my phone was glitching. There were options \"pause, forward, volume, etc.\"\r  \n\r  \nI pressed pause and all of a sudden there was silence in my neighbour's apartment. After few seconds the music started again, and I saw that the play button turned to a pause button again on my phone.\r  \n\r  \nI pressed pause again - music disappeared and behind the wall I hear \"What the fuck?\".\r  \n\r  \nI cannot describe the feelings I had in that moment, my facial expression must have looked like that Chris Pratt meme from \"Parks and rec.\" - \"Ooooohh snaaap\".\r  \n\r  \nThe music started playing again and again I pressed pause. Now I'm hearing grunts and profanities from my neighbour. I could feel his confusion and anger through the walls. I had never felt so much power in my life.\r  \n\r  \nGod, universe, or whatever you want to call it had blessed me with a gift.\r  \n\r  \nI kept fucking with him that evening. Pause, skip video, turn the volume up and down. He tried turning TV on and off, logging in and out of his youtube account and nothing seemed to work. He was soooo pissed off. Ahhh....it was the first time I was happy that the walls in our building are so thin.\r  \n\r  \nThis went on for days, turned out he mostly used Youtube on his TV to watch videos, podcasts, even to play music. He was going completely insane.\r  \n\r  \nHe did switch to Spotify(I'm guessing) for music, but still...every time he wanted to watch a podcast or some videos I was there, ready and waiting for him to feel my wrath.\r  \n\r  \nThroughout the next few months I heard him call customer support multiple times, making him reset the TV to factory settings, logging in and out of Youtube app countless of times.\r  \n\r  \nSometimes I would stop messing with it for couple of days to give him false hope, then all of a sudden when I hear him watching some comedy podcast that he is enjoying I would start playing another video for him. He would literally scream.\r  \n\r  \nLong story short, after six months of this as I'm walking down the hallway on day I saw a random couple carrying the TV out of his apartment and him holding cash in his hand.\r  \n\r  \nI drove him to selling the TV and buying a new one.... in that moment I felt bad and started to regret my actions. Felt kind of childish about the fact that I had been doing this for six months. \r",

After few seconds the music started again, and I saw that the play button turned to a pause button again on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pressed pause again - music disappeared and behind the wall I hear &amp;quot;What the fuck?&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I cannot describe the feelings I had in that moment, my facial expression must have looked like that Chris Pratt meme from &amp;quot;Parks and rec.&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;Ooooohh snaaap&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The music started playing again and again I pressed pause. Now I&amp;#39;m hearing grunts and profanities from my neighbour. I could feel his confusion and anger through the walls. I had never felt so much power in my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;God, universe, or whatever you want to call it had blessed me with a gift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kept fucking with him that evening. Pause, skip video, turn the volume up and down. He tried turning TV on and off, logging in and out of his youtube account and nothing seemed to work. He was soooo pissed off. Ahhh....it was the first time I was happy that the walls in our building are so thin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This went on for days, turned out he mostly used Youtube on his TV to watch videos, podcasts, even to play music. He was going completely insane.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He did switch to Spotify(I&amp;#39;m guessing) for music, but still...every time he wanted to watch a podcast or some videos I was there, ready and waiting for him to feel my wrath.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Throughout the next few months I heard him call customer support multiple times, making him reset the TV to factory settings, logging in and out of Youtube app countless of times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I would stop messing with it for couple of days to give him false hope, then all of a sudden when I hear him watching some comedy podcast that he is enjoying I would start playing another video for him. He would literally scream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long story short, after six months of this as I&amp;#39;m walking down the hallway on day I saw a random couple carrying the TV out of his apartment and him holding cash in his hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I drove him to selling the TV and buying a new one.... in that moment I felt bad and started to regret my actions. Felt kind of childish about the fact that I had been doing this for six months. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "10 years ago I dated this dude in the military. He still lived in the dorms and my college was right down the road from base. We were dating for a solid 2 MONTHS when his birthday rolled around. I threw him a surprise birthday party with all his friends and bought him like $300 worth of things he wanted. Halloween was the next day after his birthday and I tried to get him to go to a party with me at my friends house. He said he had to work that night because his shift got in trouble. Nov 1 came and I was in his dorm/barrack whatever you call it studying for my test before classes he was cleaning his dorm spotless because he had “room checks” that day. While I was studying I got a phone call from a mutual friend of mine and his ex gf that he was at a party on Halloween and hooked up with his most recent ex in the bathroom. While I was on the phone my ex was super intrigued on who I was talking to and what they were saying. He knew something was up but I played it off as casual convo. Mutual friend sent me receipts of the text messages the ex gf sent him. Hung up the phone and said “did you cheat on me last night?” He said no. I said “I’ll ask one more time before I receive these test messages and pictures… did you cheat on me with M Last night at the same friends house I just had your birthday party?” He said “well maybe for a little bit….” I grabbed my things and walked out to head for class. He tried to stop me at the door to his room and he tried to stop me and out his hands up to grab me and my reflexes kicked in and I punched him straight in between the eyes and immediate blood started pouringggggg down his face. I gasped for a second not realizing what i just did then kept walking to my car. He followed me to my car begging to talk and for me to stay. I left my jacket up in his dorm and asked if I could go get it. He said yes but he was staying by my car so I wouldn’t “throw anything from the balcony at his car” 😅 I got into his dorm alone and I had a sudden rage in me. I made the BIGGEST mess of his room right before dorm inspection. Threw all his laundry on the floor, his laptop, his uniform, shoes, you name it. Then took his trash bag he still hasn’t taken out and opened it on top of everything. Emptied his toothpaste by writing “cheater” on the mirror. Cut a hole in his sheets, emptied every drawer. I did all this in like 3 minutes. I grabbed my jacket, RAN downstairs and then once I was in his sight I walked super slow back to my car crying from rage. I drove off with him crying in the rear view mirror in the parking lot with a bloody face and he was crying. I got off base SO FAST and blocked his number. He ended up getting 7 stitches in his face and still has a scar to this day. Never got in trouble because I told him it would be embarrassing if his first shirt knew the reason why he got punched after i had just threw him a great party with all of them in attendance. Never spoke to him again.\n\n\nEdit to add: I know it wasn’t my finest moment lol. Unintended in just leaving peacefully until I had a moment to myself. I was mad I got played haha. I was also a very young adult. Like 20 years old young. I’ve grown a lot and I have NEVER done anything like that. In fact, I’m a pretty submissive person. But being in a previous abusive relationship to this one, I took kick boxing to learn how to defend myself. Trauma combined with instinct, I defended myself. Yes, he got 7 stitches. I didn’t know I was capable and nor was I trying to intentionally cause damage or hurt him. ",

He still lived in the dorms and my college was right down the road from base. We were dating for a solid 2 MONTHS when his birthday rolled around. I threw him a surprise birthday party with all his friends and bought him like $300 worth of things he wanted. Halloween was the next day after his birthday and I tried to get him to go to a party with me at my friends house. He said he had to work that night because his shift got in trouble. Nov 1 came and I was in his dorm/barrack whatever you call it studying for my test before classes he was cleaning his dorm spotless because he had “room checks” that day. While I was studying I got a phone call from a mutual friend of mine and his ex gf that he was at a party on Halloween and hooked up with his most recent ex in the bathroom. While I was on the phone my ex was super intrigued on who I was talking to and what they were saying. He knew something was up but I played it off as casual convo. Mutual friend sent me receipts of the text messages the ex gf sent him. Hung up the phone and said “did you cheat on me last night?” He said no. I said “I’ll ask one more time before I receive these test messages and pictures… did you cheat on me with M Last night at the same friends house I just had your birthday party?” He said “well maybe for a little bit….” I grabbed my things and walked out to head for class. He tried to stop me at the door to his room and he tried to stop me and out his hands up to grab me and my reflexes kicked in and I punched him straight in between the eyes and immediate blood started pouringggggg down his face.

( Deep down in my heart I knew yes I can make her happy ) but why did I still say that thing? Don&amp;#39;t cheat on me please, you will never leave me right? ( I knew she will never do such thing ), I lied to her for the first time ( I used to say I hate liars which I really do ) and I got caught ( I&amp;#39;m dumb I can&amp;#39;t lie ) and then I thought again why did I say all those things? Why did lie? and then atlast I was just blaming my previous relationship for my insecurities and manipulative behaviour. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never got a chance to apologize and now I&amp;#39;m disgusted of myself. I ruined her first time being in a relationship, I became exactly what she hated the most. I will never forgive myself for what I did.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "I grew up with some intrinsic urge to steal. Started young, taking change off the counter, a couple dollars from my mom's wallet. Then shoplifting candy bars and CDs from a local record shop. When CDs were popular, they would package them in these tall thin plastic packaging (anti-theft, no doubt). I'd slip the whole thing down my pants. I also stole some CDs from people I knew.\n\nIn high school, I got kicked out after my first year at a new school because I stole from my roommate. They roomed me with this rich Japanese kid who never went to class, and flaunted his wealth. I felt like why did he get to enjoy everything and not even have to go to class? But I do? I would steal Japanese yen from him, then go to the local bank and exchange for dollars. Kind of ambitious and a little fucked up. I got busted, somehow. Dad wanted to kill me. By an act of God they let me back in the next year. I was known as that kid who stole. People talked about me behind my back, and some teachers really didn't like me. They thought I should not have been allowed back in to the school, a fair point. But in the end I needed tobe in that school and I ended up graduating. In the end it was fine. Never saw that Japanese kid again.\n\nIn college I snuck into someone's room and stole some sunglasses and various other small items. I think they found it, but it was like the last day of school before everyone left.\n\nI don't know why honestly... I think I always felt like I was lacking. Saw things I wanted but didn't have. Although I came from a middle class background and never really lacked anything essential. My parents never gave me any pocket money. So as a kid, what do you do? My friends all had money. So from 14 on I had part time jobs. I worked at a seafood market. I worked at a mafia owned Italian restaurant. I delivered medicine to elderly homes. I worked at Baskin &amp; Robbins. And numerous other restaurant jobs in my teens.\n\nWhen I got to college, on the very first day I went to the job fair to get a job because my parents gave me no cash for anything. I don't know what they thought I was supposed to do. They thought since the cafeteria was included, I had food and shelter, why would I need money? Who knows. My first job at college was at the library for $4.25 an hour. Worked all through college.\n\nAfter college I tried to steal from batteries from CVS and got totally busted by security. They made me pay a $200 fine on the spot, or risk arrest. So I said I'm sorry, paid, and that was that. But I knew I never wanted to get in any real trouble with the law. Essentially I am not a criminal or a bad person. I just had this problem.\n\nThen I changed, in my early 20s.\n\nI did a year abroad in France in college. Saw the world in a different way. Had new experiences. I was humbled and intrigued by a big new world. Not sure exactly why, but I went through a transformation. And I never stole again. I grew out of it. It just became...wrong.\n\nOne of my best friends from high school, we reconnected and lived near each other a few years later in Boston. This is mid 90s now. It was good times there for a bit. But then, an incident occurred. Someone stole some music equipment from his housemate. I knew who did it, it was my other best friend. We were all a group. This guy was starting to have mental health issues and ended up schizophrenic. But that's another story. However, my friend thought I stole the equipment. It was an obvious conclusion because of what happened in high school. But I didn't do it. Actually I would never have stolen hundreds of dollars of hardware from anyone. That was beyond my ambitions, and very risky. Although he never confronted me, that ended our friendship. At that point I had ended my petty thievery, but the stigma was on me.\n\nI'm lucky I never got in more trouble than I did. Since that time I have never stolen anything again. It just didn't interest me anymore. It was wrong. I wouldn't have wanted things stolen from me, so I had more perspective and compassion as I matured.\n\nI just... grew out of it. I never wanted to hurt anyone.\n\nAnyway, this is something I have never spoken about with anyone really. People think if you were a thief then, you are always a thief. So if it ever came up for whatever reason, it's like a stigma over your head.\n\nAnyway that's my confession.",

          "selftext": "Hey, I'm Sam. Around three years ago I met someone through the internet, after a while, I completely fell in love with him, we even ended up dating. But there's something I've been doing from the start, I've been lying about who I am. I sent fake pictures, even fake voice messages for years to him and my friends. I don't know how I was capable of doing it for so long. Mainly because of how close we all were. It started to get to me, eat me from the inside. So I decided it would be great to tell them about who I really am, and finally, be honest. There was a lot of tears from both sides. But I did it. I finally told them the truth and it felt really good. My friend took it okay, which I'm to this day surprised of. And even my partner did, which I was extremely happy for. But was he really okay?\n\nIt turns out he wasn't, not at all. It hurt him a lot. And I hate the fact that I hurt him. After all, I made him fall in love with someone else. He lost a huge amount of trust for me which I admit, is valid. I tried to make it better, somehow, but I knew the mental scar will always be there, for both of us. After a while it even started to look okay, I was being all honest, and no more lies, but it was still bothering him a lot. He ended up losing his feelings for me partially and breaking up with me, but said it'd be cool to still stay friends.\n\nMy now ex partner was still someone I loved though. I could not move on so quickly, and I still didn't. His trust for me began to disappear as well, to the point he thought I was cheating on him with my friend. I think it's fair to state I used to be in a romantic relationship with \"that friend\" but it barely lasted a year, I do not feel any romantic attraction to him right now (I consider him as my family and he has a girlfriend) and my partner knew him well, and knew we used to date. That's why I thought it'd be okay. My partner was worried about me cheating on him many times, I always reassured him. I never cheated on him and never had anyone in my mind other than him. \n\nAnother thing, me and my now ex used to match profile pictures on basically every platform we used, which of course had to go after we broke up. Like a month after the break up, my friend he was worried about asked me if I'd like to match (Just a picture of our favorite sibling characters, platonic) I agreed. I don't know what I was thinking, I should've known it'd upset my now ex. When he told me about it, I thought of it, and decided to change it (not to match anymore). My friend changed it to one picture I drew of him once which upset my ex a lot, they ended up not talking anymore.\n\nWhich I think was one of the things that got him mad, he got really mad at me and ended up saying everything he really thought about my lies and about the things I did. I did not know what to say and anytime  did, I felt like I made everything worse. He's considering leaving. I don't wanna let him go. He's still such huge part of my life, and I still love him. But if he'll wanna leave, it's completely fair. \n\nThere are some things I did not like that he did, and also hurt me in a fucked up way. But I don't feel like it's very valid for me to mention it, since what I did is such shit thing to do. In fact, I cried many nights, and I was so embarrassed of myself, so ashamed, I feel like it's not valid for me to be the one hurt, I hurt everyone around me with such horrible lie.\n\nI still love him so much, and I do gotta admit, our relationship wasn't very healthy. But it hurts to see him actually consider leave. I would work on it for years to make it healthy, or to make him feel better. But it was visibly making him feel even worse. It was like a reality check when he said all the things he said. They hurt me a lot, but I think it was necessary for them to hurt so I would finally understand. I cannot stop drowning in quilt for like 6 months now and it's horrible. What's even worse is I cannot take anything I did back, even though I wish I did. I wish I never hurt him. I wish I never lied about who I am. And I wish I was at least a bit better. I feel like the worst partner ever.\n\nThanks to anyone who read it. I apologize if it seems like a shit confession, but I had to get it off my chest.",

I don&amp;#39;t know what I was thinking, I should&amp;#39;ve known it&amp;#39;d upset my now ex. When he told me about it, I thought of it, and decided to change it (not to match anymore). My friend changed it to one picture I drew of him once which upset my ex a lot, they ended up not talking anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which I think was one of the things that got him mad, he got really mad at me and ended up saying everything he really thought about my lies and about the things I did. I did not know what to say and anytime  did, I felt like I made everything worse. He&amp;#39;s considering leaving. I don&amp;#39;t wanna let him go. He&amp;#39;s still such huge part of my life, and I still love him. But if he&amp;#39;ll wanna leave, it&amp;#39;s completely fair. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are some things I did not like that he did, and also hurt me in a fucked up way. But I don&amp;#39;t feel like it&amp;#39;s very valid for me to mention it, since what I did is such shit thing to do. In fact, I cried many nights, and I was so embarrassed of myself, so ashamed, I feel like it&amp;#39;s not valid for me to be the one hurt, I hurt everyone around me with such horrible lie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I still love him so much, and I do gotta admit, our relationship wasn&amp;#39;t very healthy. But it hurts to see him actually consider leave. I would work on it for years to make it healthy, or to make him feel better. But it was visibly making him feel even worse. It was like a reality check when he said all the things he said. They hurt me a lot, but I think it was necessary for them to hurt so I would finally understand. I cannot stop drowning in quilt for like 6 months now and it&amp;#39;s horrible. What&amp;#39;s even worse is I cannot take anything I did back, even though I wish I did. I wish I never hurt him. I wish I never lied about who I am. And I wish I was at least a bit better. I feel like the worst partner ever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks to anyone who read it. I apologize if it seems like a shit confession, but I had to get it off my chest.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I have been waking up with a constant worry or unsureness, heavy feeling, upset stomach. I don’t know how to put my finger on it nor describe it. I did everything I could to move out and start a new life. I guess it’s just not going my way right now. I dreamt of going to this college since 9th grade but I didn’t think I was gonna get accepted so I went to another college. I had a very sheltered life so I ended up back at home. But it was a very toxic environment and my mothers and I relationship suffered for the last two years.\n\nSo I saved up and applied to start college for spring semester, everything was cut so short because of my abrupt leave at my previous university. I found an apartment and got a job and waited/ prayed for an acceptance letter. I knew I would’ve been moved in before I could register for classes, but as classes started, I got my answer back, denied. \n\nYep, now I’m in a new city next to a college campus with no friends. I’m so grateful that I have a way to stay afloat. I’m so grateful that I have new opportunities to experience, but is this the way it supposed to go? Should I have stayed home worked out some thing else and then moved out? I just wasn’t happy there. I thought I could be happy here because this is a city that I’ve always wanted to be, or that I’d be in classes and I can meet people on campus,clubs,dining hall.. but how do I start a life now?\nI’m just a 20 year old teenage girl in a big city with no plans now. And I did that to myself, so where the hell do I go now? And this has been haunting me for the past week. \n\nI’ve been waking up and working out, about to start my new day at my job. I also have a remote job so I’ve been inside a lot.  I have roommates, but they all think I’m in college. I just feel stuck.\n\nEdit/updated: First of all I wanna appreciate everybody that commented and left advice. I really appreciate it. I read every comment and it really gave me more drive to figure out myself in this new city. I wanted to answer your questions/assumptions. \n\nFirst, I come from a single parent household, my mom has done so much for me. But as I got older, I realized I did a lot for her. I am the oldest daughter out of six kids. I didn’t really have a life outside of home. It was my mothers way or the highway. I appreciate my mom but I can’t live for her anymore or watch my siblings 24/7, can’t hang out with friends cause she would be calling me telling me to come home. When I went to university my freshman year, I was so sheltered/socially anxious that I made so many stupid decisions. For my safety for myself, I just went home. For the last two years, 18 to 20, I realize if I have to live life for myself or I’ll forever be living for my mother. My mother and I relationship is already benefiting from the distance that we have from each other. I will be looking into community college out here since I am right next to campus I thought about going to advisor and talking about steps for an appeal. \n\nAs for staying afloat, I pay all my bills myself, my car, rent, utilities etc except for my phone bill now that I think about it lol. I appreciate my mom for teaching me my work ethic. I also wouldn’t have the remote job that pays me really good if it wasn’t for my mom… because my boss is her friend lol. Then I also have a serving job that I start tomorrow. \n\nI appreciate the advice on going on a self discovery journey. I think that opened up my mind to more of just making friends and experiencing the city with others. Cheers to starting my adult life. ",

For a while I was very paranoid walking around my neighborhood because I believed everyone was warching me, but after returning the computer I started to feel a little bit less guilty and I promised myself to never do such a thing again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Four or five over a weekend, all by himself.\n\nSo he gets sick, not felling well, tired, etc. but just puts it down to getting older and maybe not handling his liquor like he used to, but doesn't cut back at all.\n\nOnce he starts turning yellow, he gets to the doctor, who tells him his liver is shot; full cirrhosis, there's nothing left of it, whatever. He tells the doc he doesn't know why, he doesn't drink any more than the people he knows, it's a mystery, but he'll stop entirely to get put on a list for a new liver.\n\nHe obviously doesn't stop drinking, doesn't even cut back. Everyone knows it's the drinking and cirrhosis, but he and his family start calling it \"cancer\"- it's cancer, so the drinking has nothing to do with it.\n\nSo he eventually ends up in the hospital full time because there's no liver for him yet, and his family starts sneaking vodka into the hospital so he can keep drinking.\n\nHe left the hospital on a slab, and the family starts asking people for money for cancer walks, stuff like that, and not a one of them cut back the drinking at all.",

          "selftext": "Sorry for the long post \n\nWe've been married for 5 years and together for 7 years. We also have a three year old kid\n\nAfter having the baby, I struggled a lot with losing the baby weight and adjusting to being a parent. I also had the baby blues at first which was tough. I wasn't really focused on my appearance and instead I was trying to figure out our new routine and way of life.\n\nBut then my husband started making these little comments about my body and how I should start working out and wearing makeup again. It made me feel really awful and I worried that he might start looking elsewhere because we weren't being intimate anymore. He even suggested hiring a nanny so I could have more time for myself but I wanted to be there for our baby full time so I turned down the offer. That made him angry and he started acting cold towards me.\n\nMonths went by without any hugs, kisses, romance or any kind of affection. My self esteem hit rock bottom. Every time I looked in the mirror, all I saw were the flaws that my husband pointed out. By this point, our son was already 2 years old and I desperately wanted to win my husband back. I thought that if I got in shape again, he would show me love and affection and our marriage would be saved. I craved his attention so much and it hurt to see how much things had changed. But you can't force someone to be affectionate. \n\nI took matters into my own hands and hired some help. With more free time, I started going to the gym, taking swimming classes (which are amazing for your back by the way), getting my hair and lashes done regularly and eating healthier. And guess what? I've lost a ton of weight and I feel amazing.\n\nSuddenly, my husband started touching me, kissing me, buying me flowers and treating me like the complete opposite of how he treated me before. You'd think that would make me feel better but for some reason, it made me feel worse. All I could think about were the hurtful things he said to me when I was at my lowest and how cold he was towards me. I get that you can't force attraction but why couldn't he just hug me or give me a kiss on the cheek even when I was overweight? Why couldn't he love me as a human being and the mother of his child? When my self esteem came back, I got really angry at myself for putting up with his behavior for so long.\n\nA few days ago, I told him I wanted a divorce because I don't think I can move past how badly he treated me. He apologized and promised to change and prove that he can be better. But honestly I'm not sure if I can trust him again. What if I gain weight again or have to deal with health issues? Will he treat me like garbage again?\n\nI've talked to some friends and family about the whole situation and some say I should give him another chance, while others say I should leave him. So I'm turning to Reddit for some advice.\n\nAm I justified in being upset over this? Do you think it's possible for my husband to change his behavior for the long term or is a divorce the right move here?",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long post &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve been married for 5 years and together for 7 years. We also have a three year old kid&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After having the baby, I struggled a lot with losing the baby weight and adjusting to being a parent. I also had the baby blues at first which was tough. I wasn&amp;#39;t really focused on my appearance and instead I was trying to figure out our new routine and way of life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then my husband started making these little comments about my body and how I should start working out and wearing makeup again. It made me feel really awful and I worried that he might start looking elsewhere because we weren&amp;#39;t being intimate anymore. He even suggested hiring a nanny so I could have more time for myself but I wanted to be there for our baby full time so I turned down the offer. That made him angry and he started acting cold towards me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Months went by without any hugs, kisses, romance or any kind of affection. My self esteem hit rock bottom. Every time I looked in the mirror, all I saw were the flaws that my husband pointed out. By this point, our son was already 2 years old and I desperately wanted to win my husband back. I thought that if I got in shape again, he would show me love and affection and our marriage would be saved. I craved his attention so much and it hurt to see how much things had changed. But you can&amp;#39;t force someone to be affectionate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took matters into my own hands and hired some help. With more free time, I started going to the gym, taking swimming classes (which are amazing for your back by the way), getting my hair and lashes done regularly and eating healthier. And guess what? I&amp;#39;ve lost a ton of weight and I feel amazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, my husband started touching me, kissing me, buying me flowers and treating me like the complete opposite of how he treated me before. You&amp;#39;d think that would make me feel better but for some reason, it made me feel worse. All I could think about were the hurtful things he said to me when I was at my lowest and how cold he was towards me. I get that you can&amp;#39;t force attraction but why couldn&amp;#39;t he just hug me or give me a kiss on the cheek even when I was overweight? Why couldn&amp;#39;t he love me as a human being and the mother of his child? When my self esteem came back, I got really angry at myself for putting up with his behavior for so long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I told him I wanted a divorce because I don&amp;#39;t think I can move past how badly he treated me. He apologized and promised to change and prove that he can be better. But honestly I&amp;#39;m not sure if I can trust him again. What if I gain weight again or have to deal with health issues? Will he treat me like garbage again?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve talked to some friends and family about the whole situation and some say I should give him another chance, while others say I should leave him. So I&amp;#39;m turning to Reddit for some advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Am I justified in being upset over this? Do you think it&amp;#39;s possible for my husband to change his behavior for the long term or is a divorce the right move here?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

For her Christmas present, I planned an amazing trip out west - airfare, hotel and tix to her favorite band.   I had planned on proposing while we were out there - I already have a ring and she knows it.   \n\nWe travel often and our last couple trips, she has suggested either during or after that she assumed I was going to propose.  Our last trip, she was kind of quiet on our drive home from the airport - when I asked what was wrong, she said she thought I was proposing and she was sad when it didn't happen.    That was back in November and since then, I KNEW that this trip would be when I did it.  \n\nHowever, we've had some serious fights in the last month and it's left me unsure of some things - I'm not over them, not ready to forget and definitely not ready to make her think everything is perfect.   I do love her and I do think we'll probably get married *eventually*.   But in the meantime, there's a few things she needs to work on.  I don't want her assuming this is the trip - I'm sure she thinks that - but it won't happen.   And rather than have her in a funk when we get home, I'd like a way to just say \"I love you, but some things you've said lately have given me pause.  It'll happen, but not on this trip.\"  \n\nAny suggestions? \n\nEdit:   To answer some of the questions/comments:  I absolutely know there are some things I need to work on also, things we both need to work on.   But just some of the things she says, it just comes across rude - and I've given examples, but unfortunately my comments are all buried, as everyone thinks I'm the asshole.  And maybe to an extent I am.  I don't know anymore.   But, I do love her and don't feel I've \"dangled a ring in front of her\".  I was planning an engagement, she found out about it.  And the last couple months we have been fighting more, mainly because of rude comments that she's made, as of late.  I do want to marry her, I just wish she could see that some of what she says comes across as hurtful.",

          "selftext": "I (m26) am desperate for a solution to this problem. I don’t think what I did was wrong but I’m willing to hear advice because our family is so divided about this. \n\n  My fiancé (f24) is from a broken family. I will admit that I don’t have much experience in her situation but I’d like to think I’m empathetic. Basically her dad was always absent, her mother was addicted to drugs, she was raised by an older cousin and was in foster care as an older teenager until she aged out. She doesn’t talk about it a lot but despite that, she is the kindest woman I’ve ever met and extremely caring, smart, and dedicated. She’s successful in her job as an NP and obviously the love of my life. We got engaged about six months ago and our wedding date is set- I can’t wait to make her my wife. Well my fiancé has two siblings, an older brother and a younger sister. Her brother, Josh, is also a successful person and I consider him a good friend of mine. Josh and my own brother and I hang out often. \n\n  My fiancé’s sister (f21), however, is basically a splitting image of their mother. She is a drug addict and an alcoholic, an abusive and manipulative person, and just generally not someone you want to be around. \n\n  Well my fiancé, Charlotte, doesn’t see her sister that way. Charlotte has given her sister a million and one chances to prove herself, and yet her sister fails every single time. Her sister, we can call her Sarah, has stolen money, jewelry, and anything else she can get her hands on from Charlotte several times. Sarah can be so sweet and nice and promises rehab until Char will let her back in, and then snaps and steals for drugs. She has shown up on Char’s doorstep completely strung out on pills and threatened her with a knife once. Sarah has done jail time and rehab about three times over, but Charlotte just will not stop giving her chances. She is easily manipulated by Sarah’s crocodile tears and sacrifices so much for her sister who wouldn’t do the same. I just can’t stand it, seeing my fiancé so hurt by a girl who needs so much more help than she can ever give her. She finally crossed the line for me right before we got engaged- when Sarah showed up to Char’s apartment and physically assaulted her. She broke my fiancé’s nose- we had to have the photographer edit out the bruising in our engagement photos. \n\nFrom then I, I was clear to Char that I did not support her constant second chances towards Sarah. Josh (her brother) had never entertained Sarah and in strongly worded ways, told Char not to either. Charlotte’s excuse was always “she’s my sister, you can’t understand”, which might be true. But still. So, now that Charlotte has moved into my house, I haven’t heard much about Sarah. I thought Charlotte might have finally given up trying to fix her sister and I couldn’t have been happier. Until last week. As I mentioned Charlotte is a nurse practitioner so she works long hours a couple days a week. One night I was home alone and someone rang our doorbell. What do you know, it’s my least favorite person. Sarah was standing there, track marks all up and down her arms, begging me to let her in to apologize and make it up with Charlotte. Prior to this Sarah had made her apology to Char about breaking her nose and Char accepted- further proof that Sarah is just so far gone when she’s on drugs. I told Sarah no that I wasn’t going to do that and she needed to leave. Sarah refused, started yelling, saying she was going to be homeless. I told her I didn’t care. After a few more minutes of switching between crocodile tears and threats, Sarah finally left. That night I didn’t tell Char what happened as when she got home she was really tired and wanted to shower, eat and sleep. The next morning however, I did. And Charlotte was pissed. She yelled at me for “making decisions for her” and told me I had no place in doing what I did. I disagree heavily but when Char started to cry- I felt so horrible. I apologized but honestly I don’t feel that I needed too. Josh agrees with me, but some other family and friends are siding with Char. I have no idea how to fix this. I do not want my fiancé helping her sister any longer, but I don’t see how I can persuade her that her sister is the horrible person that she is. How do I prove to my fiancé that she’s better off without her sister?",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I (m26) am desperate for a solution to this problem. I don’t think what I did was wrong but I’m willing to hear advice because our family is so divided about this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My fiancé (f24) is from a broken family. I will admit that I don’t have much experience in her situation but I’d like to think I’m empathetic. Basically her dad was always absent, her mother was addicted to drugs, she was raised by an older cousin and was in foster care as an older teenager until she aged out. She doesn’t talk about it a lot but despite that, she is the kindest woman I’ve ever met and extremely caring, smart, and dedicated. She’s successful in her job as an NP and obviously the love of my life. We got engaged about six months ago and our wedding date is set- I can’t wait to make her my wife. Well my fiancé has two siblings, an older brother and a younger sister. Her brother, Josh, is also a successful person and I consider him a good friend of mine. Josh and my own brother and I hang out often. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My fiancé’s sister (f21), however, is basically a splitting image of their mother. She is a drug addict and an alcoholic, an abusive and manipulative person, and just generally not someone you want to be around. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well my fiancé, Charlotte, doesn’t see her sister that way. Charlotte has given her sister a million and one chances to prove herself, and yet her sister fails every single time. Her sister, we can call her Sarah, has stolen money, jewelry, and anything else she can get her hands on from Charlotte several times. Sarah can be so sweet and nice and promises rehab until Char will let her back in, and then snaps and steals for drugs. She has shown up on Char’s doorstep completely strung out on pills and threatened her with a knife once. Sarah has done jail time and rehab about three times over, but Charlotte just will not stop giving her chances. She is easily manipulated by Sarah’s crocodile tears and sacrifices so much for her sister who wouldn’t do the same. I just can’t stand it, seeing my fiancé so hurt by a girl who needs so much more help than she can ever give her. She finally crossed the line for me right before we got engaged- when Sarah showed up to Char’s apartment and physically assaulted her. She broke my fiancé’s nose- we had to have the photographer edit out the bruising in our engagement photos. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From then I, I was clear to Char that I did not support her constant second chances towards Sarah. Josh (her brother) had never entertained Sarah and in strongly worded ways, told Char not to either. Charlotte’s excuse was always “she’s my sister, you can’t understand”, which might be true. But still. So, now that Charlotte has moved into my house, I haven’t heard much about Sarah. I thought Charlotte might have finally given up trying to fix her sister and I couldn’t have been happier. Until last week. As I mentioned Charlotte is a nurse practitioner so she works long hours a couple days a week. One night I was home alone and someone rang our doorbell. What do you know, it’s my least favorite person. Sarah was standing there, track marks all up and down her arms, begging me to let her in to apologize and make it up with Charlotte. Prior to this Sarah had made her apology to Char about breaking her nose and Char accepted- further proof that Sarah is just so far gone when she’s on drugs. I told Sarah no that I wasn’t going to do that and she needed to leave. Sarah refused, started yelling, saying she was going to be homeless. I told her I didn’t care. After a few more minutes of switching between crocodile tears and threats, Sarah finally left. That night I didn’t tell Char what happened as when she got home she was really tired and wanted to shower, eat and sleep. The next morning however, I did. And Charlotte was pissed. She yelled at me for “making decisions for her” and told me I had no place in doing what I did. I disagree heavily but when Char started to cry- I felt so horrible. I apologized but honestly I don’t feel that I needed too. Josh agrees with me, but some other family and friends are siding with Char. I have no idea how to fix this. I do not want my fiancé helping her sister any longer, but I don’t see how I can persuade her that her sister is the horrible person that she is. How do I prove to my fiancé that she’s better off without her sister?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "Hello everyone, I need advice and since it's not something I can tell to people around me I'm posting it on here. Also please excuse my english because it's not my first language.\n\nFor a little bit of context, my father passed away at the begining of the month. We weren't really close, I think he always despised me because my birth caused the death of his wife/my mother. He remarried after but they quite never made me feels like I belonged with them, and he abandonned me shortly after. I now Got into a realy good college with a scholarship through hardwork but I'm still struggling to make relationships because of the abuse and all, and can't really afford therapy because of the amount of works i'm putting myself in.\n\nHe wasn’t really that abusive, often beating me up but i think he was more clumsy with people than anything, didn’t know how to handle me.   \nI grew up in a lot of terrible places and only a teacher helped me a lot (buying me food, school supplies etc) and encouraged me to study. I gave my all in school , and actually working a lot for my degree on my own. I’m actually alone and i have only a cat for real friend and family.  \n I recently learned my father’s death, I wasn’t sad or relieved or anything, but long story short he gave me all his inheritance (we are talking of a lot of money, too much for me, my moms ring and the house).  \nBut there is the problem, his new family (my 2 step brothers and 2 step sisters) with another woman(she is french). And they contacted me to discuss about this. As they are actually living in the house. I agreed to meet them and everything was nice. I felt like i had a family for the first time in my life, and i always wanted to have a relationship with my siblings. The woman (let’s call her Jane) was really nice with me, said things like I could come anytime i want, get dinner with them, be part of the family. I agreed to let them stay in the house for free, and to give them all of the money my « father » gave me, since i didn’t want that dirty money (or anything from him really) in the first place.   \nOne day, my youngest half sister, Claire asked me if i wanted to be put in the whatsapp family group, I almost cried at this proposition tbh and said yes. The exact same day at the afternoon i saw a message in french (i will put it on my profile ) of Jane, calling me a dumb pigeon, naive and easy to « manipulate » and one of my half brother and sister (the two older) agreeing with her.

Also please excuse my english because it&amp;#39;s not my first language.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a little bit of context, my father passed away at the begining of the month. We weren&amp;#39;t really close, I think he always despised me because my birth caused the death of his wife/my mother. He remarried after but they quite never made me feels like I belonged with them, and he abandonned me shortly after. I now Got into a realy good college with a scholarship through hardwork but I&amp;#39;m still struggling to make relationships because of the abuse and all, and can&amp;#39;t really afford therapy because of the amount of works i&amp;#39;m putting myself in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He wasn’t really that abusive, often beating me up but i think he was more clumsy with people than anything, didn’t know how to handle me.&lt;br/&gt;\nI grew up in a lot of terrible places and only a teacher helped me a lot (buying me food, school supplies etc) and encouraged me to study. I gave my all in school , and actually working a lot for my degree on my own. I’m actually alone and i have only a cat for real friend and family.&lt;br/&gt;\n I recently learned my father’s death, I wasn’t sad or relieved or anything, but long story short he gave me all his inheritance (we are talking of a lot of money, too much for me, my moms ring and the house).&lt;br/&gt;\nBut there is the problem, his new family (my 2 step brothers and 2 step sisters) with another woman(she is french). And they contacted me to discuss about this. As they are actually living in the house. I agreed to meet them and everything was nice. I felt like i had a family for the first time in my life, and i always wanted to have a relationship with my siblings. The woman (let’s call her Jane) was really nice with me, said things like I could come anytime i want, get dinner with them, be part of the family. I agreed to let them stay in the house for free, and to give them all of the money my « father » gave me, since i didn’t want that dirty money (or anything from him really) in the first place.&lt;br/&gt;\nOne day, my youngest half sister, Claire asked me if i wanted to be put in the whatsapp family group, I almost cried at this proposition tbh and said yes. The exact same day at the afternoon i saw a message in french (i will put it on my profile ) of Jane, calling me a dumb pigeon, naive and easy to « manipulate » and one of my half brother and sister (the two older) agreeing with her. They didn’t know i was in the group and i was just speechless. Just message that i wanted them gone in a month from the house and that i will give them nothing, and left the group.&lt;br/&gt;\nI have now my mail and call box full of calls and messages on how i am horrible to put an entire family in the street by their family and them, on how they are sorry and everything to make me guilty.

Thats when my boyfriend told me that, no matter the scenerio, he would always want a paternity test for any kids he has. He said we could be locked away in an isolated cabin for the entirety of a pregnancy and he would still want a test, just to be sure. He said he would do all the leg work of scheduling the test, showing up to it, and paying for it. His reasoning for wanting this is that as a man, you can never truly, 100% know if a kid is yours without the test so he would want it just in case. He also mentioned hearing too many horror stories about men raising children that werent theirs. He wanted to let me know all of this now, before we were thinking about having kids, because asking for one after i was pregnant or while we were trying would be offensive.\n\nIn the moment, i felt kinda disgusted at the request, but thought bringing it up now WAS a lot better than bringing it up later. I also am a woman, so i will know 100% that any kids i have will be mine. Therefore, i hid my disgust and told him that it would be fine. But the more i thought about it, the more i hated it. Asking for a paternity test, in pretty much any scenerio, is an accusation of cheating. Its saying you don't trust your parnter enough to not cheat AND you dont trust your partner enough not to trick you into raising a child thats not yours. Bringing it up before thinking about having kids is better than bringing it up afterwards, but still seems like a red flag. \n\nTry as i might, i cant stop myself from feeling hurt by this. I have no intention of ever cheating on my boyfriend, so I can only really see it as an inability to trust. So now i am here, asking for perspective. Is this a reasonable request from him? Is the perspective of this situation from a mans view something i just cant see? Any thoughts would be appreciated. \n\n\nTLDR: Boyfriend told me if he ever had kids, he will want a paternity test. I got some hardcore ick from his sentiments. Is there a perspective im not seeing in all this? Can someone help me understand his perspective?",

Why is he not with her then? Is he with me just because she wasn't available? Because he didn't find anyone better and I just happened to be his least worst opinion?\n\nAny advice on how to deal with this situation is welcome.",

Why is he not with her then? Is he with me just because she wasn&amp;#39;t available? Because he didn&amp;#39;t find anyone better and I just happened to be his least worst opinion?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any advice on how to deal with this situation is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

She was also always pretty strong, does massage therapy and was really good at deep tissue.  I mean, there are times when she has worked on me and it hurt, and Im not a small guy\n\nAbout 6 months ago, she started changing things.  Not really eating junk food, and she joined some classes at the ymca…..yoga and some cardio.\n\nSince then, the weight has really fallen off her.  I don’t know exactly how much because the few times Ive asked her, she has said, “I dont know because I dont care to weigh myself” so I just drop it.\n\nBut if I had to guess, I think she has lost at least 20-25 lbs if not more.  She seems healthy in terms of energy and her skin has really cleared up, but I have noticed some other things.\n\nI was doing laundry, which I do a lot, and her jeans are now only size 0-2. \n\nDoing massage, she has to do her own sheets, and the other day, I heard her really struggling to carry the bag of laundry up the stairs.  Yes, its a big bag, but never have I noticed that and we’ve been together for years. ……… I asked her if “you ok with that?” And she just said she needs a strong man to help her out and started flirting and getting intimate with me. (Is she changing the subject?)\nWhich leads me to my next point.  Without too much info, she looks completely different without clothes.  She had some curves etc before but now shes pretty much a figure like a ballerina…..and she says she feels great, but I recently picked her up during the act and it was literally like nothing.\n\nAnother big thing I noticed was she worked on me again for massage last week, and all of the deep pressure she had before, was gone and I could tell she was really struggling.  But if I bring it up she gets defensive and tells me she feels better than ever and I should be happy for her, which I am.  I just worry and dont know what to do\n\nThe final straw here was our dog, who likes to walk underneath our legs all the time and nudge her head up, and has done so since she was a puppy, literally lifted my wife off the ground last night.  My wife laughed about it like it was funny, but I was alarmed.  Our dog is part mastiff (we think) and about 85-90 lbs……but still, that has never happened before.\n\nI just don’t  know how to approach her.  Every time I have, she shuts it down.

I cant blame someone for wanting to be healthy but I just want to make sure shes okay.\n\nTL;DR! Wife lost weight…… She says she feels great but Ive noticed she’s lost quite a bit and am concerned.

She lives with relatives after being a refugee from war.\n\nFirst, thank you all to those who gave advice and properly explained to me what I wasn't considering in a gentle manner. Sometimes, people aren't in the right mind or are straight up ignorant like I was. I also appreciate those who also wished me luck/well. You guys rock!\n\nAfter giving her some space, I spent a few days away from work and mindlessly driving around. I drove for hours in in open air away from dense civilization to clear my head and think about my priorities. I was thinking about what you all said and realized how right some of you were.\n\nShe found out that she may be pregnant, and the love of her life, who constantly calls me his \"life partner\"(and vice-versa), basically told her to abort their potential child. I couldn't be more angry with myself. Am I damn hypocrite? Just because my life plans aren't planned out exactly in order, doesn't mean I should suggest something like abortion as if it were an easy thing to do! You wanted to start a family with her you idiot.\n\nAnyway, on my way back, I made certain I was committed and drove by 3 jewelers looking for engagement rings. I did fine 2 that I wanted, but decided to wait until maybe Friday to message her and ask to talk in person before buying it. However, we met in person sooner than expected.\n\nMeeting with her in person, she revealed that the second pregnancy test she took at the doctors resulted in a negative, so she wasn't pregnant (She provided a screenshot of the result). I guess the at-home pregnancy test threw a false positive. I'll be honest guys, I was slightly disappointed this time but kept my thoughts to myself.\n\nWe talked at length in person as I wanted to get her full thoughts in person. She explained that she essentially wanted to keep the opposite of what I said. She felt very upset and even wanted to hit me in the face right there. She then went home and cried saying she basically no longer \"felt protected\". I'd rather she just hit me. This absolutely floored me and I wanted to do nothing more than to somehow go back in time and undo what I said. But I can't.\n\nI told her in my best stance, I love her. I want to be with her and wanted to start a family with her. I explained that I thought I was thinking of her when I suggested abortion and she explained to me what that meant and the affects of it (which I learned from the last post). But I was wrong. I apologized and asked if she still wanted to stay together. She said yes, she can't stop loving me \"like a simple switch\".\n\nI promised her that we can rebuild this together and I'll make sure to work to make her smile everyday and to build her confidence in me once again knowing I'll never abandon her.\n\nThings have been tense since. She avoids direct kisses but still reciprocates hugs. She's been on her phone more often and says she isn't available to go on dates this week for vague reasons. I'm trying to give the benefit of the doubt here and think she just wants space and isn't quite ready to jump back in yet.\n\nSo, other than spending time and keeping open dialogue, what are some other ways that I can rebuild this relationship? Anything I haven't considered or missed out? Thanks!\n\nTL;DR Wasn't pregnant, says she wants to continue our relationship but everything is tense right now.",

She lives with relatives after being a refugee from war.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, thank you all to those who gave advice and properly explained to me what I wasn&amp;#39;t considering in a gentle manner. Sometimes, people aren&amp;#39;t in the right mind or are straight up ignorant like I was. I also appreciate those who also wished me luck/well. You guys rock!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After giving her some space, I spent a few days away from work and mindlessly driving around. I drove for hours in in open air away from dense civilization to clear my head and think about my priorities. I was thinking about what you all said and realized how right some of you were.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She found out that she may be pregnant, and the love of her life, who constantly calls me his &amp;quot;life partner&amp;quot;(and vice-versa), basically told her to abort their potential child. I couldn&amp;#39;t be more angry with myself. Am I damn hypocrite? Just because my life plans aren&amp;#39;t planned out exactly in order, doesn&amp;#39;t mean I should suggest something like abortion as if it were an easy thing to do! You wanted to start a family with her you idiot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, on my way back, I made certain I was committed and drove by 3 jewelers looking for engagement rings. I did fine 2 that I wanted, but decided to wait until maybe Friday to message her and ask to talk in person before buying it. However, we met in person sooner than expected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meeting with her in person, she revealed that the second pregnancy test she took at the doctors resulted in a negative, so she wasn&amp;#39;t pregnant (She provided a screenshot of the result). I guess the at-home pregnancy test threw a false positive. I&amp;#39;ll be honest guys, I was slightly disappointed this time but kept my thoughts to myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We talked at length in person as I wanted to get her full thoughts in person. She explained that she essentially wanted to keep the opposite of what I said. She felt very upset and even wanted to hit me in the face right there. She then went home and cried saying she basically no longer &amp;quot;felt protected&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;d rather she just hit me. This absolutely floored me and I wanted to do nothing more than to somehow go back in time and undo what I said. But I can&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told her in my best stance, I love her. I want to be with her and wanted to start a family with her. I explained that I thought I was thinking of her when I suggested abortion and she explained to me what that meant and the affects of it (which I learned from the last post). But I was wrong. I apologized and asked if she still wanted to stay together. She said yes, she can&amp;#39;t stop loving me &amp;quot;like a simple switch&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I promised her that we can rebuild this together and I&amp;#39;ll make sure to work to make her smile everyday and to build her confidence in me once again knowing I&amp;#39;ll never abandon her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things have been tense since. She avoids direct kisses but still reciprocates hugs. She&amp;#39;s been on her phone more often and says she isn&amp;#39;t available to go on dates this week for vague reasons. I&amp;#39;m trying to give the benefit of the doubt here and think she just wants space and isn&amp;#39;t quite ready to jump back in yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, other than spending time and keeping open dialogue, what are some other ways that I can rebuild this relationship? Anything I haven&amp;#39;t considered or missed out? Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR Wasn&amp;#39;t pregnant, says she wants to continue our relationship but everything is tense right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Please help me understand if what I am feeling is wrong or if I need to talk to him about what I feel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

This includes her parents, her siblings + spouses, and herself.  She told me a couple of years ago that the group chat doesn't exist anymore but I found it active today while our toddler was playing with mom's phone.  I asked my wife if this was a new group chat (yes) and why wasn't I in it?  She became extremely irritated and defending it saying \"you don't even like my family\" and things of that nature.\n\nSo fuck it, I threw my hands up and said I guess I'm not family anymore.  Told her I'm not cooking dinner tonight, not doing any of the cleaning, not watching after our daughter, etc.  I'm apparently not family, why act like it?  I wouldn't act this if it was just her side of the family, or all women, or whatever.  But it's *the entire family except for me.*  How do I move forward from here?  What are some potential reasons I'm being segregated from the rest of her family?  I come from a very dysfunctional and problem family so I blacklisted almost all of my blood relatives, so it hurts to have a potential real family put me in the proverbial corner.\n\nI tried posting this on the marriage advice sub but it wouldn't let me for some reason.\n\n**Quick EDIT:**  Didn't expect this to blow up like it did, been away from my computer most of the evening, I'll post a longer update here in an hour or two once I'm home.  **I do want to clarify that I'm still caring for my daughter, that was an overreaction on my part.**\n\n**Actual EDIT:** There are a lot of questions so I'll try to address some of the more common ones.  I'm very much a \"rough around the edges\" type of person, I come off pretty harsh but mean well.. just a bad part of my personality I guess.  I don't have a very strong relationship with her family because we don't live near any of them, and I was the last one to marry into the family.  Also very few of them have social media presence at all, they just aren't like that.\n\nThe biggest issue I've had was with her mother.  When our daughter was just a few months old, she came and visited us for an extended stay.  The only thing I asked of her was to close the doors quietly, as our daughter had some very serious sleeping issues early on.  She slammed every door closed each and every time she had the opportunity... I don't think it was really malicious more than it was her being aloof beyond all comprehension.  Finally, one night she did it around 3am and our daughter woke up screaming.  I had been polite with repeated asks up until this point, and finally I snapped and yelled \"why do you keep slamming the fucking doors?\"  She moved her flight and left the next day, and didn't speak to me for several months.  This interaction is the only evidence my wife has that I don't like her family.\n\n**Breaking up the EDIT so it doesn't seem like a massive text wall:** Anyway - there are a lot of issues that I could drone on and on about for hours, both parties.  I haven't been exactly a \"picturesque\" father but I'm getting better.  I could tell you that I didn't grow up with a nice family, so I don't know what normal even looks like, much less trying to be a part of one.  Someone mentioned CPTSD and yes I've seen counselors over the years regarding this, I also do some mild meditating now and then when emotions start getting out of control.  Thanks to everyone for the responses, both sides of the argument.  We can all get better so I appreciate the feedback.\n\n**There's a certain user in this thread** that keeps posting older threads of mine that I've made that indicate I have other issues.  Yes I have a pretty lengthy history of anger issues and attending management courses; haven't been to one in a couple of years because I found a counselor to talk about my issues which has helped me cope with different levels of stress.. which induces the anger.  Also I had a brief stint of gambling with crypto, which I lost *some* money, not the \"truckloads\" this particular user states.  We all have a past, sorry mine offends you, I'm just trying to grow and be better.  Keep searching, I have nothing to hide.  Thanks for trying to drag me back into a hole I'm still crawling out of.",

Honestly this whole situation didn’t offend me much (but it did a little) because of how amazing he is otherwise. This is what happened. \n\nMe, my fiancé, my sister and her husband, and a few other friends (like 6 others) all took a group trip recently to go skiing. We stayed at an air b&amp;b and the first night, we ended up getting a bit more intoxicated then most of us intended lol. Most of the girls in the group had crashed for the night by midnight. I wasn’t drinking heavily though so at around 1 am I was outside with my fiancé, my sisters husband, and another male friend around the fire pit. We were talking about dumb stuff for about an hour before I decided I was ready to go to bed. I kissed my fiancé and headed up to our room. Like twenty mins later I realized I had left my hair clip outside and ran down quickly to get it. However, when I reached the door I could hear them talking so I stopped to listen. This is what I heard. \n\nMy fiancé- yeah I was fucking nervous\n\nMy sisters husband- you knew she was going to say yes though\n\nMy fiancé- yeah but it still makes you nervous. i love her so much. \n\nMale friends- congrats by the way, haven’t said it. she’s a good woman\n\nMy fiancé- I know. thanks. she wants a big wedding and I don’t, but I’ll let her have it because I just want her to be my wife. \n\nMy sisters husband- it’s rare to find a girl that good, I know because I got her sister \n\nMy fiancé- *laughter* I know. She’s amazing and I love her. She’s gonna be a great wife. And also…. I found the only woman on the planet willing to blow me daily. I had to marry her. \n\n/*all three of them laugh at that dumbass joke/*\n\nFirst of all, I don’t even “blow” him daily. Just when we have sex which is like 3-4 times a week so it’s not even true. Secondly, airing my business out like that is crazy imo. I was a bit offended but just carried on like I hadn’t heard it. I’ve thought about it twice since it happened and I’m a little offended but also not really…. I don’t know. How common is this? Is it just “boys being boys” or is this something I need to be truly offended over?

We have been together over 20 years and have three young children, I did not want to give up on it and encouraged him to stay. He stayed and although his reasons for staying are the children, we both have been working hard on rebuilding a new relationship. We began marriage counselling and we have a deeper communication with one another. I have been initiating more intimacy and things seem to be going well. \n\nFrom our first marriage counselling sessions, he talked about his feelings for his affair partner, saying he loves her and that he would like for her to still play some part in his life. The marriage counsellor says that while he has feelings for her it wouldn't be appropriate. I thought with time he would simply forget about her and shift focus to what's important (i.e. his family, his wife). But last week he brought her up again and wanted to know if he can reconcile with her and have a friendship with her. I said I wasn't ready, I'm hoping to stall this until he stops asking. He said he understood that it might be too soon. \n\nI am worried if I never allow him to speak to her, he might just start talking to her behind my back.

I’ve known about her since the beginning because she’s part of the group but by no means at all are they close friends and this is the first time that they’ve ever hung out in the 3 years that me and him have been together. We all live in LA now. They grew up in the same country in Europe together, but they didn’t know each other while they were growing up. My boyfriend went back to his home country for the holidays and left one of his credit cards at his parents house. This girl picked it up while she was there and brought it back, so they were meeting for him to pick up the card. Anyways, he left for dinner around 9 pm and our door opens at 1:35 am and I’m awoken by them coming in. I thought okay maybe she needs to use the bathroom. Nope. I hear a bottle of wine open. They’ve been sitting drinking wine and talking for the last 45 minutes and I’m just in the bedroom in absolute belief. I’m feeling really fiery and honestly like this crossed the line for me but before I unleash I think maybe it’s better to cool down and get some outside perspectives. How would you feel in this situation?\n\nEDIT: I just want to clarify something that I feel like a lot of people are not understanding. They haven’t not seen each other for 3 years. We all live in LA. ii was stating in the almost 3 years that my boyfriend and I have been together, my boyfriend and this girl have never hung out together, despite us all living in a 5 mile radius. She is a girl we’d see at parties and say hello to. I barely knew they were friends.  \n\nFINAL EDIT: It’s not about them banging and it’s not about them hanging out. It’s about my man bringing home another woman to our house for hours at 1:30 am while I’m sleeping to drink and do drugs with….. it’s extremely disrespectful and inappropriate. Although most of the people here don’t see it that way, I’m glad I made this post to help me solidify how I feel about this situation. ",

A week ago, my parents invited us for dinner and we gladly accepted as we couldnt get together with them during christmas. Everyone including my sisters and one of the sister's bf was there.\n\nIn the evening, my dad and husband spent a lot of time together, went for fishing nearby and drank a bit while i remained sober to drive us back. The dinner went great and i didnt think there was any problem. But on the ride back home, hubby was unusually quiet and serious and was just staring out the window the whole time, i just thought that he was too drunk.\n\nBut for a couple days after that, he was acting very cold towards me. No real communication or teasing or joking, no backslaps or random hugs and no intimacy. When i asked him about it, he just told me to remember the conversation at dinner and would not say anything else.\n\nHe reverted back to normal after a couple days and is now exactly like he was before. But just stubbornly wont tell me what exactly made him upset. I dont remember anything said at dinner that might have rubbed him the wrong way. The only thing remotely close would be my sister talking about my ex-bf for a few seconds, but my husband already know everything about me and my ex-bf so that cant be the problem.\n\nHe always would share anything that he finds uncomfortable with me but he doesnt this time. When i asked him again yesterday, he just told me to forget about it. I am concerned whether he has formed a negative impression about me or my family. How would i make him comfortable enough to tell me what happened? I would appreciate some perspectives.\n\nTldr: Husband acted distant towards me after a family dinner.

I feel unwanted and not sexy. Not to mention, the other day he told me he’s attracted to women who have drive to go to the gym everyday. lol what a jerk. I’m 5’9 and 140lbs so by no means am I fat. I’m just not super toned or anything and that’s what he likes. He’s always looking up girls on social media too. Anyway, if you were in his place would you watch the videos too if you found out you worked with someone who makes adult videos? How do I get over this? I just want to feel good enough and sexy.

And this kind of bothers me.. he doesn’t know I know he watches her stuff. In my mind, I’m thinking he wants to f*ck her and fantasizes about it all the time. Makes me feel kinda shitty tbh. Like I’m afraid he wants to sleep with her/other people.. and I’m not enough. I feel unwanted and not sexy. Not to mention, the other day he told me he’s attracted to women who have drive to go to the gym everyday. lol what a jerk. I’m 5’9 and 140lbs so by no means am I fat. I’m just not super toned or anything and that’s what he likes. He’s always looking up girls on social media too. Anyway, if you were in his place would you watch the videos too if you found out you worked with someone who makes adult videos? How do I get over this? I just want to feel good enough and sexy. I don’t feel that way right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
