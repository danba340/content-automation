          "selftext": "Late to the party but this one is too good to pass up:\n\nI was once on a US military ship, having breakfast in the wardroom (officers lounge) when the Operations Officer (OPS) walks in.  This guy was the definition of NOT a morning person; he's still half asleep, bleary eyed... basically a zombie with a bagel.  He sits down across from me to eat his bagel and is just barely conscious.  My back is to the outboard side of the ship, and the morning sun is blazing in one of the portholes putting a big bright-ass circle of light right on his barely conscious face.  He's squinting and chewing and basically just remembering how to be alive for today.  It's painful to watch.\n\nBut then zombie-OPS stops chewing, slowly picks up the phone, and dials the bridge.  In his well-known I'm-still-totally-asleep voice, he says \"heeeey.  It's OPS.  Could you... shift our barpat... yeah, one six five.  Thanks.\" And puts the phone down.  And then he just sits there.  Squinting.  Waiting.\n  \nAnd then, ever so slowly, I realize that that big blazing spot of sun has begun to slide off the zombie's face and onto the wall behind him.  After a moment it clears his face and he blinks slowly a few times and the brilliant beauty of what I've just witnessed begins to overwhelm me.  By ordering the bridge to adjust the ship's back-and-forth patrol by about 15 degrees, he's changed our course just enough to reposition the sun off of his face.  He's literally just redirected thousands of tons of steel and hundreds of people so that he could get the sun out of his eyes while he eats his bagel.  I am in awe.  \n\nHe slowly picks up his bagel and for a moment I'm terrified at the thought that his own genius may escape him, that he may never appreciate the epic brilliance of his laziness (since he's not going to wake up for another hour).  But between his next bites he pauses, looks at me, and gives me the faintest, sly grin, before returning to gnaw slowly on his zombie bagel.",

I threw it out and thought little of it.\n\nOn the 19th, I found another post it note on the back of my desk chair, in the same handwriting as the previous note, telling me to make sure I \"saved my documents\". I was  freaked out, but there were no other signs of a break-in, so I set up a web-cam in my house aimed at my desk and used a security-cam app for it to record after detecting movement.\n\nOn the 28th, I woke up to find another post-it note, this one saying, \"Our landlord isn't letting me talk to you, but it's important we do.\" I immediately checked the webcam's folder on my computer and found nothing from the night before, but my computer's recycling bin had been emptied, which I am certain I did not do recently, indicating someone had noticed the webcam and deleted the files. (They were just saved straight to a folder on my desktop called \"Webcam\". \n\nToday, on the 1st of May, I found another post it note, this time on the outside of my door, with nothing written on it– and there also appeared to be post-its on many other doors in my apartment complex, all blank, in varying colors.\n\nDo I have any legal recourse here? I have no proof except for the post-its, but those are written by my pen and on my post-it notes, so conceivably I could have faked them. Would contacting the police get me into any trouble, if they can't determine an outside source for this? I just want to make sure I'm not wasting anyone's time. \n\nShould I consult my landlord?

          "selftext": "I was day tripping to Vancouver from Seattle and stopped in for lunch at a little cafe.  From my window I saw a young teenage girl out in the cold, squatted down in a closed up businesses doorway, holding a small bundle in her arms.  She was panhandling, people were mostly walking by ignoring her.  She looked just broken.\r\n\r\nI finished up my meal and went outside, went through my wallet and thought I'd give her $5 for some food.   I got up to her and she was sobbing, she looked like she was 14-15.  And that bundle in her arms was a baby wrapped up.  I felt like I just got punched in the chest.  She looked up putting on a game face and asked for any change, I asked her if she's like some lunch. Right next door was a small quick-Trip type grocery store, I got a can of formula for the baby (very young, maybe 2-3 months old.), and took her back to the cafe though I'd just eaten.  She was very thankful, got a burger and just inhaled it. Got her some pie and ice cream.  She opened up and we talked.  She was 15, got pregnant, parents were angry and she was fighting with them.   She ran away.  She's been gone almost 1 full year.\r\n\r\nI asked her if she's like to go home and she got silent.  I coaxed her, she said her parents wouldn't want her back.  I coaxed further, she admitted she stole 5k in cash from her Dad.  Turns out 5k doesn't last long at all and the streets are tough on a 15 year old.  Very tough.  She did want to go back, but she was afraid no one wanted her back after what she did.\r\n\r\nWe talked more, I wanted her to use my phone to call home but she wouldn't.  I told her I'd call and see if her folks wanted to talk to her, she hesitated and gave bad excuses but eventually agreed.  She dialed the number and I took the phone, her Mom picked up and I said hello.  Awkwardly introduced myself and said her daughter would like to speak to her, silence, and I heard crying.  Gave the phone to the girl and she was just quiet listening to her Mom cry, and then said hello.  And she cried.  They talked, she gave the phone back to me, I talked to her Mom some more.\r\n\r\nI drove her down to the bus station and bought her a bus ticket home.  Gave her $100 cash for incidentals, and some formula, diapers, wipes, snacks for the road.\r\n\r\nGot to the bus, and she just cried saying thank you over and over.  I gave her a kiss on the forehead and a hug, kissed her baby, and she got on the bus.\r\n\r\nI get a chistmas card every year from her.  She's 21 now and in college.\r\n\r\nHer name is Makayla and her baby was Joe.  \r\n\r\nI've never really told anyone about this.  I just feel good knowing I did something good in this world.  Maybe it'll make up for the things I've f-ed up.",

I also remember looking at my brother on his iPad with max brightness and thinking to myself \"he should turn down the brightness or he'll bother uncle\". It wasn't until the next morning when I got woken up with a knock at the door, and it was the detectives and my uncle's parole officer. They spoke with my grandma and told her my uncle was in the hospital, I didn't think too much of it because he had went to the hospital a week prior for stomach issues.\n\nAn hour later I got a call from my sister crying saying my uncle had been hit by a car and was brain dead. For the rest of the day I thought that this had to have happened sometime after 3 in the morning. Later that night we found out that it had happened around 9:30, while I was at work and before I even got home.\n\nI don't really know what to think of it.

I put on a dog YouTube channel and got in the shower. He followed me in the bathroom and waited by the door, then all of the sudden he trotted off very intentionally. I was worried he was going to do something naughty like pee somewhere or look for a shoe to chew on, but he ignored my calls which was odd for him. Normally he comes running. When I got out of the shower, I called his name, but he was nowhere to be found. I looked in the closet, under the bed, everywhere he possibly could be. I heard a faint whimper, like he was trapped somewhere. It was muffled like he was trapped under blankets or behind a wall, but my bed was made and there was nowhere he could have been. I wondered if maybe he fell between the mattress or something, but I checked and he wasn’t there either. I thought I was going crazy. \n\nI checked under the bed one more time and then when I looked up, he dropped onto the bed like he was exiting stairs or being dropped from somewhere, and was wagging his tail like, “what is it?” Like nothing had happened. It was very strange and I cannot imagine where he would have gone. He just reappeared very randomly out of thin air.",

I put on a dog YouTube channel and got in the shower. He followed me in the bathroom and waited by the door, then all of the sudden he trotted off very intentionally. I was worried he was going to do something naughty like pee somewhere or look for a shoe to chew on, but he ignored my calls which was odd for him. Normally he comes running. When I got out of the shower, I called his name, but he was nowhere to be found. I looked in the closet, under the bed, everywhere he possibly could be. I heard a faint whimper, like he was trapped somewhere. It was muffled like he was trapped under blankets or behind a wall, but my bed was made and there was nowhere he could have been. I wondered if maybe he fell between the mattress or something, but I checked and he wasn’t there either. I thought I was going crazy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I checked under the bed one more time and then when I looked up, he dropped onto the bed like he was exiting stairs or being dropped from somewhere, and was wagging his tail like, “what is it?” Like nothing had happened. It was very strange and I cannot imagine where he would have gone. He just reappeared very randomly out of thin air.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "My sister moved multiple states away 3 years ago.\n\nHer husband gives her very thoughtful jewelry pieces every mother's day. They're always extremely sentimental and bespoke to convey a specific sentiment or memory. \n\n2 years ago, he gave her a gold necklace with a heart, carved inside with their family's initials and year of birth, with diamonds to the center where the heart meets a point (because it's their daughter's birthstone). Since being given that gift, she's never left the state to visit home. She's also never been to my current house even before leaving (I also live pretty far from home and family hasn't made the visit, but I've lived here 7 years now and haven't moved or spent long visits with my family, just daytime drop ins). \n\nMy sister's necklace went missing some time in spring last year. She thought it might have broken and fallen off while out and about and she was very distressed about it because it was an expensive gift and felt horrible about it going missing. When we chatted about it she actually told me she wasn't going to tell her husband about it until she's searched EVERYWHERE possible. The entire house, the car, her work place. She even called the stores she's shopped at regularly asking if it was found and turned in, but nothing. \n\nJust this week I was pulling out old clothes and shoes to donate. My son went through a growth spurt and I got wider and I figured it was time to clean house. I was pulling out all the shoes and purses at the bottom of my closet and there, in the very back of my closet, I found my sister's necklace. \n\nThere's absolutely NO way that this could have ended up here. My sister hasn't come home to visit and there's no way this would have ended up in our state in MY HOUSE without her having mailed it personally, and she's never mailed me anything (besides sending gifts directly from the seller that she'd never have personally touched). And it's not as though it's a similar looking piece, or a mass produced item. This was specifically carved with their birth years and initials, and their daughters diamond birth stone. \n\nBut it gets even more strange. I immediately face time her when I find it. I was already trying to figure out how on earth it would have come to be in my closet... I haven't gone to her state yet, my son hasn't visited there, our parents had but they went before she had gotten the gift. When she picked up and I showed her what I had found I was honestly bracing myself because I was sure she was going to be just as confused and have a million questions I couldn't answer. But when I showed her what I found, she set the phone down to put herself in full view, and pulled out her necklace from under her blouse. She had her necklace!! Not just that, but she had no recollection of losing it. No memory at all of talking to me about losing it, searching her house, or calling shops. In fact she was sure she's always had it in her jewelry box and thought I was being weird about finding the same one because it was likely a really common necklace. When I pointed out that it had their same initials and birth years carved into it, she just shrugged and said it was a coincidence but not all that strange. When I pressed it she laughed and assumed I was pulling a prank of some kind (which is EXTREMELY out of my character, I am not one to pull pranks) and asked if I had it made as some kind of joke. \n\nI am at a total loss here. I feel like reality is all jumbled up and I'm the only one who noticed it's off. I was so confused so I called our mom and told her what happened. I told her the whole thing asking if she recalled her losing the necklace, I was sure if she did it would have come up in their calls as well. She didn't recall anything. But the way she acted in the call was even more strange, she says 'well these things happen don't let it drive you crazy, our family is just sensitive to these things' and then wouldn't elaborate on it. Which is also very unlike her character.\n\nhttps://postimg.cc/JD2cyMbn",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My sister moved multiple states away 3 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her husband gives her very thoughtful jewelry pieces every mother&amp;#39;s day. They&amp;#39;re always extremely sentimental and bespoke to convey a specific sentiment or memory. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 years ago, he gave her a gold necklace with a heart, carved inside with their family&amp;#39;s initials and year of birth, with diamonds to the center where the heart meets a point (because it&amp;#39;s their daughter&amp;#39;s birthstone). Since being given that gift, she&amp;#39;s never left the state to visit home. She&amp;#39;s also never been to my current house even before leaving (I also live pretty far from home and family hasn&amp;#39;t made the visit, but I&amp;#39;ve lived here 7 years now and haven&amp;#39;t moved or spent long visits with my family, just daytime drop ins). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My sister&amp;#39;s necklace went missing some time in spring last year. She thought it might have broken and fallen off while out and about and she was very distressed about it because it was an expensive gift and felt horrible about it going missing. When we chatted about it she actually told me she wasn&amp;#39;t going to tell her husband about it until she&amp;#39;s searched EVERYWHERE possible. The entire house, the car, her work place. She even called the stores she&amp;#39;s shopped at regularly asking if it was found and turned in, but nothing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just this week I was pulling out old clothes and shoes to donate. My son went through a growth spurt and I got wider and I figured it was time to clean house. I was pulling out all the shoes and purses at the bottom of my closet and there, in the very back of my closet, I found my sister&amp;#39;s necklace. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s absolutely NO way that this could have ended up here. My sister hasn&amp;#39;t come home to visit and there&amp;#39;s no way this would have ended up in our state in MY HOUSE without her having mailed it personally, and she&amp;#39;s never mailed me anything (besides sending gifts directly from the seller that she&amp;#39;d never have personally touched). And it&amp;#39;s not as though it&amp;#39;s a similar looking piece, or a mass produced item. This was specifically carved with their birth years and initials, and their daughters diamond birth stone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it gets even more strange. I immediately face time her when I find it. I was already trying to figure out how on earth it would have come to be in my closet... I haven&amp;#39;t gone to her state yet, my son hasn&amp;#39;t visited there, our parents had but they went before she had gotten the gift. When she picked up and I showed her what I had found I was honestly bracing myself because I was sure she was going to be just as confused and have a million questions I couldn&amp;#39;t answer. But when I showed her what I found, she set the phone down to put herself in full view, and pulled out her necklace from under her blouse. She had her necklace!! Not just that, but she had no recollection of losing it. No memory at all of talking to me about losing it, searching her house, or calling shops. In fact she was sure she&amp;#39;s always had it in her jewelry box and thought I was being weird about finding the same one because it was likely a really common necklace. When I pointed out that it had their same initials and birth years carved into it, she just shrugged and said it was a coincidence but not all that strange. When I pressed it she laughed and assumed I was pulling a prank of some kind (which is EXTREMELY out of my character, I am not one to pull pranks) and asked if I had it made as some kind of joke. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am at a total loss here. I feel like reality is all jumbled up and I&amp;#39;m the only one who noticed it&amp;#39;s off. I was so confused so I called our mom and told her what happened. I told her the whole thing asking if she recalled her losing the necklace, I was sure if she did it would have come up in their calls as well. She didn&amp;#39;t recall anything. But the way she acted in the call was even more strange, she says &amp;#39;well these things happen don&amp;#39;t let it drive you crazy, our family is just sensitive to these things&amp;#39; and then wouldn&amp;#39;t elaborate on it. Which is also very unlike her character.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://postimg.cc/JD2cyMbn\"&gt;https://postimg.cc/JD2cyMbn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

My boyfriend gets up to grab a snack from the kitchen while we let the episode keep playing. \nOur kitchen and living room are separated by a thin wall, as the kitchen leads to the living room. So he could still hear the episode well in case any action picked up. Well, one character says something along the lines of \"why do you care about this woman anyway? She is a criminal\". Mind you, we were watching subbed, so all this is in Japanese. I'm reading subtitles, but my boyfriend can't at the moment. But after the character asked that question, my boyfriend from the kitchen yells \"because she's my friend, dumbass!\"\nI pause the episode immediately and walk into the kitchen and ask how my boyfriend knew what they were saying. He got this look of realization followed by confusion and horror on his face. His exact response was \"I don't know, I just....I don't know\".\nHe's never spoken another language other than English. Never taken any Japanese classes, never even downloaded Duolingo. \nWe are both just so creeped out by it.\n\nETA: I don't believe he watched the episode without me, as we don't care if each other is a couple of episodes ahead sometimes. He will usually tell me when he does like \"hey I watched these episodes while you were asleep, so I know what happens\". But he claims he didn't watch ahead this time.",

My boyfriend gets up to grab a snack from the kitchen while we let the episode keep playing. \nOur kitchen and living room are separated by a thin wall, as the kitchen leads to the living room. So he could still hear the episode well in case any action picked up. Well, one character says something along the lines of &amp;quot;why do you care about this woman anyway? She is a criminal&amp;quot;. Mind you, we were watching subbed, so all this is in Japanese. I&amp;#39;m reading subtitles, but my boyfriend can&amp;#39;t at the moment. But after the character asked that question, my boyfriend from the kitchen yells &amp;quot;because she&amp;#39;s my friend, dumbass!&amp;quot;\nI pause the episode immediately and walk into the kitchen and ask how my boyfriend knew what they were saying. He got this look of realization followed by confusion and horror on his face. His exact response was &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know, I just....I don&amp;#39;t know&amp;quot;.\nHe&amp;#39;s never spoken another language other than English. Never taken any Japanese classes, never even downloaded Duolingo. \nWe are both just so creeped out by it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ETA: I don&amp;#39;t believe he watched the episode without me, as we don&amp;#39;t care if each other is a couple of episodes ahead sometimes. He will usually tell me when he does like &amp;quot;hey I watched these episodes while you were asleep, so I know what happens&amp;quot;. But he claims he didn&amp;#39;t watch ahead this time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Only those closest to me know that this happened until now.\n\n  \nWhen I was 25 years old I was driving home from work one night. I lived in Los Angeles at the time. I was driving on Sunset Boulevard heading west towards my apartment in Brentwood.  For those that are not familiar with the area there is an expanse of Sunset, near UCLA, that is very curvy. It is 2 lanes on either side with no shoulder.\n\n  \nIt was 8:30 on a Saturday night so there was some traffic. I was driving along and all of a sudden about 50 feet in front of me I saw a car but I was looking at the passenger door. A car had spun out of control and was perpendicular in my lane. I didn't have time to stop. I looked to my right and saw there was a car next to me so I had nowhere to go. I instinctively turned my car all the way to the right anyway. Once I had cleared the first car I spun it all the way to the left still trying to avoid the 2nd car.\n\n  \nWhile all of  this was happening I remembered a time with my mom at Disneyworld when I was 3. This is not a memory I have ever had. I vaguely remember parts of that trip but this memory was not one of them. I realized then that my life was flashing before me and I was going to die. I had never been so sure of anything. Every part of me knew I was about to die. I started screaming, to this day I don't know if I vocalized anything or it was all in my head. I yelled \"No, no this isn't fair. I'm not done yet\", all the while swerving all over Sunset Blvd. I suddenly stopped my car and I was now perpendicular in the opposing lane of traffic.\n\n  \nI looked around and there was not a single car anywhere. It was like everything had been wiped clean. I put my car in reverse and proceeded home. I did not see a single car the rest of the way. I was only 5 minutes away from home at that point but Sunset Blvd on a Saturday night was completely empty. I got to my apartment and parked on the street. I didn't see one person. While walking to my apartment I came to the conclusion that I had died and because I said \"No\" I was stuck in some limbo.\n\n  \nI had never wanted my roommate to be home so badly, unfortunately she wasn't. I called one of my best friends and said, \"I need to ask you some questions. Please just answer me and I will explain after\". I asked her my name, my age, what city we lived in and the date. Obviously she was very alarmed. I explained that I thought I was dead and I wasn't sure I was really on the phone with her. She tried to convince me that I was alive and that everything was okay.\n\n  \nThere was no way mathematically to escape it. There was nowhere for the car on the right to go.  \nThis moment has haunted me my whole life. There have been times when I have questioned my existence. I've wondered if my \"life\" since has been a very detailed death trip and I'm actually lying on Sunset Blvd bleeding out.\n\nAfter many years of meditation, spiritual practice and belief in quantum physics, I wonder what life I jumped into.  \n",

          "selftext": "Hi there, I’m a 39 year old female, and this occurred I think a little over a year ago.  This was a very real event.  No drugs, no alcohol.  I was in our bathroom which has a line of sight out the back window to where my hubby passes by before coming in the door.  So, I was just doing my hair, and looked over to see him outside the window walking up, switching the Kroger bag to his other hand to grab his keys, etc., then heard the door, and watched him walk by to the kitchen.  I said “Hey baby” and he didn’t hear me (not surprising, his hearing isn’t the best) but I heard him lay the bags down, then lay his keys and wallet down, so I stuck a clip in that last bit of hair to do, and started out the bathroom door to go give him a hug/kiss.      Well here it is.  Instantly, when I walked outside the doorway of the bathroom, everything was completely different.  All the lights were out, and they had certainly been on a moment prior. Totally weirded out, I felt shaky and what not, but I guess managed to walk a few steps to look toward the kitchen, only to see my husband wasn’t even there.  Then, before I even had time to attempt to process what the hell just happened, I saw through our kitchen window, his headlights coming down the driveway.  It was then I started getting extra weirded out and for sure had to sit down.  I remember I propped myself sitting on the edge of the couch arm, and the next part is what freaks me out the absolute most.  I couldn’t believe my eyes at all- as I watched him walk across that window, it was like someone had just literally rewound a tape and was replaying it.  The exact same motions, the same exact sounds.  All the way through including him setting the keys and bags down.  The only thing I could think at that point is how crazy I would actually sound if I told anyone this  (Except told my husband right when he got there.) So, I just want to know if anyone has any ideas of what happened… I’m open to hear about it.  It’s the single most unbelievable, existential type thing that’s happened in my life,  I will never ever forget it.  Thank you anyone who bothered to read/respond!",

It is also the place of his current preschool, but at that time, he attended a different preschool and had NEVER stepped foot in or talked about the big white church. \n\nSo we drove by one day and he said “oh there’s the church that I ate cereal in”. My husband and I looked at each other and I said, “what do you mean? We’ve never been there before”. We asked some additional questions but he didn’t really answer. However, he was very adamant about being there and eating cereal. \n\nThis happened during a very difficult time\nin our lives. My father in law was on hospice and dying of cancer. For weeks, we were up and back to my in laws house- this church being along the route. He said it a few more times and then never mentioned it again. \n\nFast forward to today- he currently attends preschool at said church.  He has been going since September and we love it. It is Christian though we aren’t very religious. Anyway, I got the monthly newsletter and it mentioned that next month is pajama day where the kids wear pajamas and….eat cereal. \n\nI told my son and asked him if he remembered eating cereal there before. He said no and had no recollection of saying that he did.\n\nIs there an explanation to this? It gives me chills when I think about it.",

This church is one that we pass often driving around town. It is also the place of his current preschool, but at that time, he attended a different preschool and had NEVER stepped foot in or talked about the big white church. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we drove by one day and he said “oh there’s the church that I ate cereal in”. My husband and I looked at each other and I said, “what do you mean? We’ve never been there before”. We asked some additional questions but he didn’t really answer. However, he was very adamant about being there and eating cereal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This happened during a very difficult time\nin our lives. My father in law was on hospice and dying of cancer. For weeks, we were up and back to my in laws house- this church being along the route. He said it a few more times and then never mentioned it again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today- he currently attends preschool at said church.  He has been going since September and we love it. It is Christian though we aren’t very religious. Anyway, I got the monthly newsletter and it mentioned that next month is pajama day where the kids wear pajamas and….eat cereal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told my son and asked him if he remembered eating cereal there before. He said no and had no recollection of saying that he did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there an explanation to this? It gives me chills when I think about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I returned to my home country after 1 year from a university abroad. My father picked me up from the airport ,and we had dinner at home. Everything was as usual as it could be. I went bed around 12 PM and slept immediately. I woke up around 5 AM to pee ,and went directly to the bathroom which is in my room, so I didn't stepped out of my room.\r\n\nWe all think different things when peeing such as the colour of the walls or what to eat for breakfast. For this time; out of nowhere I started thinking that if I were to choose one would i choose my mother or my father is being dead. Then, I thought my sister would be devastated without my mother, and my father cannot handle my sister in her teenage years. I decided that absence of my father would be easier than losing my mother.\r\n\nI finished peeing and just about to get back to my bed, I heard a strong snoring noise. My father was always snoring since my childhood, and sometimes we were having fun with it. However, this time it felt stronger and not natural. The noise led me to the living room where I found my father lying on the couch, with a little blood on his nose. I tried to woke him up ,but he was unconscious. I called 911, woke my mother up, but once we arrived to the hospital, he was passed away. He was 48. Doctors said it is because celebral hemorrhage by high blood pressure. We dont know what time it happened.\r\n\nI am still confused with the situation. I wasnt there for 1 year, and had the chance of having one last dinner and conversation with my father. I found him like that and acted with cold blood. I cant imagine the trauma they would live through if my mother or sister would find him lying on the couch.\r\n\nAnd of course, I still think why did I think such thing in the bathroom, and what would happen if I would choose my mother.\r\n\nThank you for reading and sharing my memory",

The dog had a barking problem too, but I'm not hating on the dog.\r  \n\r  \nOne evening I had problems with the internet and for shits and giggles I tried to connect to my neighbour's wifi with a password - \"0123456789\". Guess what...it connected :D.\r  \n\r  \nThe same evening at 11PM I started hearing shitty drum n bass from my neighbor's apartment as usual and all of a sudden I see a pop up appear on my phone.\r  \n\r  \nI have a Samsung phone and when you open the YouTube app on any Samsung Smart TV, a pop up appears on your phone with the TV casted YouTube app (as long as both devices are on the same wifi network). You have full control of \"TV YouTube\" on your phone. Pause, play, volume, skip video if it's a playlist, choose a different recommended video, etc.\r  \n\r  \nAt first I did not realize what the pop up was and just thought \"Wtf is this\". I thought my phone was glitching. There were options \"pause, forward, volume, etc.\"\r  \n\r  \nI pressed pause and all of a sudden there was silence in my neighbour's apartment. After few seconds the music started again, and I saw that the play button turned to a pause button again on my phone.\r  \n\r  \nI pressed pause again - music disappeared and behind the wall I hear \"What the fuck?\".\r  \n\r  \nI cannot describe the feelings I had in that moment, my facial expression must have looked like that Chris Pratt meme from \"Parks and rec.\" - \"Ooooohh snaaap\".\r  \n\r  \nThe music started playing again and again I pressed pause. Now I'm hearing grunts and profanities from my neighbour. I could feel his confusion and anger through the walls. I had never felt so much power in my life.\r  \n\r  \nGod, universe, or whatever you want to call it had blessed me with a gift.\r  \n\r  \nI kept fucking with him that evening. Pause, skip video, turn the volume up and down. He tried turning TV on and off, logging in and out of his youtube account and nothing seemed to work. He was soooo pissed off. Ahhh....it was the first time I was happy that the walls in our building are so thin.\r  \n\r  \nThis went on for days, turned out he mostly used Youtube on his TV to watch videos, podcasts, even to play music. He was going completely insane.\r  \n\r  \nHe did switch to Spotify(I'm guessing) for music, but still...every time he wanted to watch a podcast or some videos I was there, ready and waiting for him to feel my wrath.\r  \n\r  \nThroughout the next few months I heard him call customer support multiple times, making him reset the TV to factory settings, logging in and out of Youtube app countless of times.\r  \n\r  \nSometimes I would stop messing with it for couple of days to give him false hope, then all of a sudden when I hear him watching some comedy podcast that he is enjoying I would start playing another video for him. He would literally scream.\r  \n\r  \nLong story short, after six months of this as I'm walking down the hallway on day I saw a random couple carrying the TV out of his apartment and him holding cash in his hand.\r  \n\r  \nI drove him to selling the TV and buying a new one.... in that moment I felt bad and started to regret my actions. Felt kind of childish about the fact that I had been doing this for six months. \r",

After few seconds the music started again, and I saw that the play button turned to a pause button again on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pressed pause again - music disappeared and behind the wall I hear &amp;quot;What the fuck?&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I cannot describe the feelings I had in that moment, my facial expression must have looked like that Chris Pratt meme from &amp;quot;Parks and rec.&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;Ooooohh snaaap&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The music started playing again and again I pressed pause. Now I&amp;#39;m hearing grunts and profanities from my neighbour. I could feel his confusion and anger through the walls. I had never felt so much power in my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;God, universe, or whatever you want to call it had blessed me with a gift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kept fucking with him that evening. Pause, skip video, turn the volume up and down. He tried turning TV on and off, logging in and out of his youtube account and nothing seemed to work. He was soooo pissed off. Ahhh....it was the first time I was happy that the walls in our building are so thin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This went on for days, turned out he mostly used Youtube on his TV to watch videos, podcasts, even to play music. He was going completely insane.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He did switch to Spotify(I&amp;#39;m guessing) for music, but still...every time he wanted to watch a podcast or some videos I was there, ready and waiting for him to feel my wrath.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Throughout the next few months I heard him call customer support multiple times, making him reset the TV to factory settings, logging in and out of Youtube app countless of times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I would stop messing with it for couple of days to give him false hope, then all of a sudden when I hear him watching some comedy podcast that he is enjoying I would start playing another video for him. He would literally scream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long story short, after six months of this as I&amp;#39;m walking down the hallway on day I saw a random couple carrying the TV out of his apartment and him holding cash in his hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I drove him to selling the TV and buying a new one.... in that moment I felt bad and started to regret my actions. Felt kind of childish about the fact that I had been doing this for six months. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "10 years ago I dated this dude in the military. He still lived in the dorms and my college was right down the road from base. We were dating for a solid 2 MONTHS when his birthday rolled around. I threw him a surprise birthday party with all his friends and bought him like $300 worth of things he wanted. Halloween was the next day after his birthday and I tried to get him to go to a party with me at my friends house. He said he had to work that night because his shift got in trouble. Nov 1 came and I was in his dorm/barrack whatever you call it studying for my test before classes he was cleaning his dorm spotless because he had “room checks” that day. While I was studying I got a phone call from a mutual friend of mine and his ex gf that he was at a party on Halloween and hooked up with his most recent ex in the bathroom. While I was on the phone my ex was super intrigued on who I was talking to and what they were saying. He knew something was up but I played it off as casual convo. Mutual friend sent me receipts of the text messages the ex gf sent him. Hung up the phone and said “did you cheat on me last night?” He said no. I said “I’ll ask one more time before I receive these test messages and pictures… did you cheat on me with M Last night at the same friends house I just had your birthday party?” He said “well maybe for a little bit….” I grabbed my things and walked out to head for class. He tried to stop me at the door to his room and he tried to stop me and out his hands up to grab me and my reflexes kicked in and I punched him straight in between the eyes and immediate blood started pouringggggg down his face. I gasped for a second not realizing what i just did then kept walking to my car. He followed me to my car begging to talk and for me to stay. I left my jacket up in his dorm and asked if I could go get it. He said yes but he was staying by my car so I wouldn’t “throw anything from the balcony at his car” 😅 I got into his dorm alone and I had a sudden rage in me. I made the BIGGEST mess of his room right before dorm inspection. Threw all his laundry on the floor, his laptop, his uniform, shoes, you name it. Then took his trash bag he still hasn’t taken out and opened it on top of everything. Emptied his toothpaste by writing “cheater” on the mirror. Cut a hole in his sheets, emptied every drawer. I did all this in like 3 minutes. I grabbed my jacket, RAN downstairs and then once I was in his sight I walked super slow back to my car crying from rage. I drove off with him crying in the rear view mirror in the parking lot with a bloody face and he was crying. I got off base SO FAST and blocked his number. He ended up getting 7 stitches in his face and still has a scar to this day. Never got in trouble because I told him it would be embarrassing if his first shirt knew the reason why he got punched after i had just threw him a great party with all of them in attendance. Never spoke to him again.\n\n\nEdit to add: I know it wasn’t my finest moment lol. Unintended in just leaving peacefully until I had a moment to myself. I was mad I got played haha. I was also a very young adult. Like 20 years old young. I’ve grown a lot and I have NEVER done anything like that. In fact, I’m a pretty submissive person. But being in a previous abusive relationship to this one, I took kick boxing to learn how to defend myself. Trauma combined with instinct, I defended myself. Yes, he got 7 stitches. I didn’t know I was capable and nor was I trying to intentionally cause damage or hurt him. ",

He still lived in the dorms and my college was right down the road from base. We were dating for a solid 2 MONTHS when his birthday rolled around. I threw him a surprise birthday party with all his friends and bought him like $300 worth of things he wanted. Halloween was the next day after his birthday and I tried to get him to go to a party with me at my friends house. He said he had to work that night because his shift got in trouble. Nov 1 came and I was in his dorm/barrack whatever you call it studying for my test before classes he was cleaning his dorm spotless because he had “room checks” that day. While I was studying I got a phone call from a mutual friend of mine and his ex gf that he was at a party on Halloween and hooked up with his most recent ex in the bathroom. While I was on the phone my ex was super intrigued on who I was talking to and what they were saying. He knew something was up but I played it off as casual convo. Mutual friend sent me receipts of the text messages the ex gf sent him. Hung up the phone and said “did you cheat on me last night?” He said no. I said “I’ll ask one more time before I receive these test messages and pictures… did you cheat on me with M Last night at the same friends house I just had your birthday party?” He said “well maybe for a little bit….” I grabbed my things and walked out to head for class. He tried to stop me at the door to his room and he tried to stop me and out his hands up to grab me and my reflexes kicked in and I punched him straight in between the eyes and immediate blood started pouringggggg down his face.

( Deep down in my heart I knew yes I can make her happy ) but why did I still say that thing? Don&amp;#39;t cheat on me please, you will never leave me right? ( I knew she will never do such thing ), I lied to her for the first time ( I used to say I hate liars which I really do ) and I got caught ( I&amp;#39;m dumb I can&amp;#39;t lie ) and then I thought again why did I say all those things? Why did lie? and then atlast I was just blaming my previous relationship for my insecurities and manipulative behaviour. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never got a chance to apologize and now I&amp;#39;m disgusted of myself. I ruined her first time being in a relationship, I became exactly what she hated the most. I will never forgive myself for what I did.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "I grew up with some intrinsic urge to steal. Started young, taking change off the counter, a couple dollars from my mom's wallet. Then shoplifting candy bars and CDs from a local record shop. When CDs were popular, they would package them in these tall thin plastic packaging (anti-theft, no doubt). I'd slip the whole thing down my pants. I also stole some CDs from people I knew.\n\nIn high school, I got kicked out after my first year at a new school because I stole from my roommate. They roomed me with this rich Japanese kid who never went to class, and flaunted his wealth. I felt like why did he get to enjoy everything and not even have to go to class? But I do? I would steal Japanese yen from him, then go to the local bank and exchange for dollars. Kind of ambitious and a little fucked up. I got busted, somehow. Dad wanted to kill me. By an act of God they let me back in the next year. I was known as that kid who stole. People talked about me behind my back, and some teachers really didn't like me. They thought I should not have been allowed back in to the school, a fair point. But in the end I needed tobe in that school and I ended up graduating. In the end it was fine. Never saw that Japanese kid again.\n\nIn college I snuck into someone's room and stole some sunglasses and various other small items. I think they found it, but it was like the last day of school before everyone left.\n\nI don't know why honestly... I think I always felt like I was lacking. Saw things I wanted but didn't have. Although I came from a middle class background and never really lacked anything essential. My parents never gave me any pocket money. So as a kid, what do you do? My friends all had money. So from 14 on I had part time jobs. I worked at a seafood market. I worked at a mafia owned Italian restaurant. I delivered medicine to elderly homes. I worked at Baskin &amp; Robbins. And numerous other restaurant jobs in my teens.\n\nWhen I got to college, on the very first day I went to the job fair to get a job because my parents gave me no cash for anything. I don't know what they thought I was supposed to do. They thought since the cafeteria was included, I had food and shelter, why would I need money? Who knows. My first job at college was at the library for $4.25 an hour. Worked all through college.\n\nAfter college I tried to steal from batteries from CVS and got totally busted by security. They made me pay a $200 fine on the spot, or risk arrest. So I said I'm sorry, paid, and that was that. But I knew I never wanted to get in any real trouble with the law. Essentially I am not a criminal or a bad person. I just had this problem.\n\nThen I changed, in my early 20s.\n\nI did a year abroad in France in college. Saw the world in a different way. Had new experiences. I was humbled and intrigued by a big new world. Not sure exactly why, but I went through a transformation. And I never stole again. I grew out of it. It just became...wrong.\n\nOne of my best friends from high school, we reconnected and lived near each other a few years later in Boston. This is mid 90s now. It was good times there for a bit. But then, an incident occurred. Someone stole some music equipment from his housemate. I knew who did it, it was my other best friend. We were all a group. This guy was starting to have mental health issues and ended up schizophrenic. But that's another story. However, my friend thought I stole the equipment. It was an obvious conclusion because of what happened in high school. But I didn't do it. Actually I would never have stolen hundreds of dollars of hardware from anyone. That was beyond my ambitions, and very risky. Although he never confronted me, that ended our friendship. At that point I had ended my petty thievery, but the stigma was on me.\n\nI'm lucky I never got in more trouble than I did. Since that time I have never stolen anything again. It just didn't interest me anymore. It was wrong. I wouldn't have wanted things stolen from me, so I had more perspective and compassion as I matured.\n\nI just... grew out of it. I never wanted to hurt anyone.\n\nAnyway, this is something I have never spoken about with anyone really. People think if you were a thief then, you are always a thief. So if it ever came up for whatever reason, it's like a stigma over your head.\n\nAnyway that's my confession.",

          "selftext": "Hey, I'm Sam. Around three years ago I met someone through the internet, after a while, I completely fell in love with him, we even ended up dating. But there's something I've been doing from the start, I've been lying about who I am. I sent fake pictures, even fake voice messages for years to him and my friends. I don't know how I was capable of doing it for so long. Mainly because of how close we all were. It started to get to me, eat me from the inside. So I decided it would be great to tell them about who I really am, and finally, be honest. There was a lot of tears from both sides. But I did it. I finally told them the truth and it felt really good. My friend took it okay, which I'm to this day surprised of. And even my partner did, which I was extremely happy for. But was he really okay?\n\nIt turns out he wasn't, not at all. It hurt him a lot. And I hate the fact that I hurt him. After all, I made him fall in love with someone else. He lost a huge amount of trust for me which I admit, is valid. I tried to make it better, somehow, but I knew the mental scar will always be there, for both of us. After a while it even started to look okay, I was being all honest, and no more lies, but it was still bothering him a lot. He ended up losing his feelings for me partially and breaking up with me, but said it'd be cool to still stay friends.\n\nMy now ex partner was still someone I loved though. I could not move on so quickly, and I still didn't. His trust for me began to disappear as well, to the point he thought I was cheating on him with my friend. I think it's fair to state I used to be in a romantic relationship with \"that friend\" but it barely lasted a year, I do not feel any romantic attraction to him right now (I consider him as my family and he has a girlfriend) and my partner knew him well, and knew we used to date. That's why I thought it'd be okay. My partner was worried about me cheating on him many times, I always reassured him. I never cheated on him and never had anyone in my mind other than him. \n\nAnother thing, me and my now ex used to match profile pictures on basically every platform we used, which of course had to go after we broke up. Like a month after the break up, my friend he was worried about asked me if I'd like to match (Just a picture of our favorite sibling characters, platonic) I agreed. I don't know what I was thinking, I should've known it'd upset my now ex. When he told me about it, I thought of it, and decided to change it (not to match anymore). My friend changed it to one picture I drew of him once which upset my ex a lot, they ended up not talking anymore.\n\nWhich I think was one of the things that got him mad, he got really mad at me and ended up saying everything he really thought about my lies and about the things I did. I did not know what to say and anytime  did, I felt like I made everything worse. He's considering leaving. I don't wanna let him go. He's still such huge part of my life, and I still love him. But if he'll wanna leave, it's completely fair. \n\nThere are some things I did not like that he did, and also hurt me in a fucked up way. But I don't feel like it's very valid for me to mention it, since what I did is such shit thing to do. In fact, I cried many nights, and I was so embarrassed of myself, so ashamed, I feel like it's not valid for me to be the one hurt, I hurt everyone around me with such horrible lie.\n\nI still love him so much, and I do gotta admit, our relationship wasn't very healthy. But it hurts to see him actually consider leave. I would work on it for years to make it healthy, or to make him feel better. But it was visibly making him feel even worse. It was like a reality check when he said all the things he said. They hurt me a lot, but I think it was necessary for them to hurt so I would finally understand. I cannot stop drowning in quilt for like 6 months now and it's horrible. What's even worse is I cannot take anything I did back, even though I wish I did. I wish I never hurt him. I wish I never lied about who I am. And I wish I was at least a bit better. I feel like the worst partner ever.\n\nThanks to anyone who read it. I apologize if it seems like a shit confession, but I had to get it off my chest.",

I don&amp;#39;t know what I was thinking, I should&amp;#39;ve known it&amp;#39;d upset my now ex. When he told me about it, I thought of it, and decided to change it (not to match anymore). My friend changed it to one picture I drew of him once which upset my ex a lot, they ended up not talking anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which I think was one of the things that got him mad, he got really mad at me and ended up saying everything he really thought about my lies and about the things I did. I did not know what to say and anytime  did, I felt like I made everything worse. He&amp;#39;s considering leaving. I don&amp;#39;t wanna let him go. He&amp;#39;s still such huge part of my life, and I still love him. But if he&amp;#39;ll wanna leave, it&amp;#39;s completely fair. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are some things I did not like that he did, and also hurt me in a fucked up way. But I don&amp;#39;t feel like it&amp;#39;s very valid for me to mention it, since what I did is such shit thing to do. In fact, I cried many nights, and I was so embarrassed of myself, so ashamed, I feel like it&amp;#39;s not valid for me to be the one hurt, I hurt everyone around me with such horrible lie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I still love him so much, and I do gotta admit, our relationship wasn&amp;#39;t very healthy. But it hurts to see him actually consider leave. I would work on it for years to make it healthy, or to make him feel better. But it was visibly making him feel even worse. It was like a reality check when he said all the things he said. They hurt me a lot, but I think it was necessary for them to hurt so I would finally understand. I cannot stop drowning in quilt for like 6 months now and it&amp;#39;s horrible. What&amp;#39;s even worse is I cannot take anything I did back, even though I wish I did. I wish I never hurt him. I wish I never lied about who I am. And I wish I was at least a bit better. I feel like the worst partner ever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks to anyone who read it. I apologize if it seems like a shit confession, but I had to get it off my chest.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
